## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/7?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.1.8)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.8/doc/index.html)

### Interfaces

A new entity type can now be defined: [interface](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.8/doc/tutorial-DEFINE.html).

Being able to define interfaces and to check if an object conforms with their specification will normalize and improve
the way encapsulations are handled within the library but also when using it.

### Release optimization

When the library is built, some source manipulations occur:

* Each module is individually transformed into an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) structure
using [esprima](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esprima)
* These structures are concatenated inside an
[Universal Module Definition loader](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/UMD.js)
* Eventually, the result is serialized using [escodegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/escodegen)

Before this release, the debug and release versions were almost the same.
The main differences were:
* The release version is serialized without the comments
(see [rewriteOptions](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/release.json))
* Also, the release version is minified using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)

Because I am planning to implement some optimization patterns on the release
version, I started to redesigne the build process. After converting all the relevant sources to ES6, I realized that
the former [AST manipulation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.7/make/ast.js) was not working
properly. Indeed, it was trying to rename all variables to shorten them but... it didn't work. Not a big deal because
UglifyJS was already doing the job.

So I rewrote the [AST manipulation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.8/make/ast.js) to start
optimizing the concatenated AST structure.

#### Estimating functions usage

I implemented a detection of unused functions which revealed that
[_gpfIsUnsignedByte](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.8/src/constants.js#L140-L142) was actually not
used ! Hence, it is removed from the output.

#### NOP

The build process includes a [pre-processor](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.8/make/preprocess.js)
capable of conditioning some JavaScript lines using C-like defines. However, as a lazy developer, I don't want to wrap
all DEBUG specific functions inside a #ifdef / #endif pair.

That's why some variables are tagged with a comment containing only gpf:nop. This is a way to signal that the variable
represents a no operation.

For instance:
```javascript
/*#ifdef(DEBUG)*/

// DEBUG specifics

_gpfAssertAttributeClassOnly = function (value) {
    _gpfAsserts({
        "Expected a class parameter": "function" === typeof value,
        "Expected an Attribute-like class parameter": value.prototype instanceof _gpfAttribute
    });
};

_gpfAssertAttributeOnly = function (value) {
    _gpfAssert(value instanceof _gpfAttribute, "Expected an Attribute-like parameter");
};

/* istanbul ignore if */ // Because tested in DEBUG
if (!_gpfAssertAttributeClassOnly) {

/*#else*/

    /*gpf:nop*/ _gpfAssertAttributeClassOnly = _gpfEmptyFunc;
    /*gpf:nop*/ _gpfAssertAttributeOnly = _gpfEmptyFunc;

/*#endif*/

/*#ifdef(DEBUG)*/

}
```

The optimizer is now capable of locating all variables flagged with gpf:nop and safely remove them from the output.

### Automated release (final)

In the last release, I forgot one last step: closing the milestone.
This is now [done](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/148).

## Lessons learned

### Performance measurement

One of the biggest challenge when dealing with performances is to establish one point of reference. Indeed, if you want
to quantify how much you gain, you need to make sure that the environment remains the same for each measurement session.

In my case, this is tough. Furthermore, I don't have any performance specific tests.
Hence, I decided to reuse the test cases (that cover almost all the library) and compare the debug version with the release one.
By quantifying the difference of execution between the two versions, this would give me a good indication on how much
the release is optimized.
Today, both version demonstrates similar performances, even after implementing some of the optimizations

### jsdoc plugin

In the article [My own jsdoc plugin](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2016/12/my-own-jsdoc-plugin.html), I explained how
I tweaked jsdoc to facilitate generation of the documentation.

However, I noticed that the defineTags could be a better alternative to define custom tags. After trying to experiment
it (knowing that jsdoc plugins are really badly documented), it appeared that it is extremely limited:
* No lookup function to access other doclets
* Very limited information on the current doclet (for instance: I tried to implement @gpf:chainable but the memberOf
property was not set). Indeed, we can't know when the onTagged is triggered (no control on the order).

## Next release

The [next release](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/8) will introduce some features that are required
for a side project I created.
