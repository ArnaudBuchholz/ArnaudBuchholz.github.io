    I have read lots of articles about JavaScript interviews: what are the tricky questions, how you should answer them,
    what are the hot topics, which frameworks you should be looking at...
    In the past, I was in charge a building a team of JavaScript developers to work on an AngularJS application.
    Here is the question I was asking and why.

<code class="markdown">

## The interview process

I have spent a lot of time doing interviews. Whether I was the one answering questions or the one asking them.

3600 seconds, how long is that? When you try to assess someone to join a team, you want to

- Assess the knowldege of the candidate
- Check how the new hire would fit the team

And one hour is a very short time.

Everybody wants to hire the JavaScript super star. But if he is the only one being able to work on his code, then you
are running for troubles.




When it comes to JavaScript, it i

3600 seconds are not enough to estimate how much someone would fit a position, if you will

## The question



`for (var i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
	setTimeout(function () {
  	alert(i);
  }, 1000);
}`

It illustrates the following concepts:
- closures
- asynchronous code
- synchronous code (the alert blocks any other JS execution)

How would you fix to have it to display 0..9 instead

## The challenge

The code you will write should work on any hosts (browser, NodeJS, Rhino, Nashorn, PhantomJS, cscript...).
The Cyclomatic complexity should not exceed 1 (i.e. no if).
The goal is to access the global context within this IIFE:

`(function () {
    "use strict";

    var globalContext = /* your code here */ {};

    /* Example of use */
    if (!globalContext.Promise) {
    	globalContext.Promise = /* A custom polyfill */ {};
    }

}())`
