    I have heard about Internet Of Things a number of times but I never had a chance to experiment it with microchips.
    Thanks to my job, I have the possibility to try some components. I want to keep track and share my progress and
    discoveries so I will write short - and raw - articles about this topic.

So I finally have the chance to play with a [Wemos D1 miniPro](https://www.wemos.cc/product/d1-mini-pro.html).

![Here is the beast](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/iot-1/DSCN5072.jpg)

Today, what I know is:
* It is small
* It has 4 Megs of memory
* It owns several inputs/outputs
* It does not consume too much power
* It has an inbuilt [wifi antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11).

I have thousands of questions regarding what it can do (and how to do it)... but before playing with it,
I need to setup my workstation so that I can develop and upload programs to it.

After installing the portable version of [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (which is a ZIP file)
and all the things to [get started with Wemos](https://www.wemos.cc/tutorial/get-started-arduino.html) it looks like
the USB connection is not detected properly.

So I decided to go with the windows installer version to see if the drivers would be installed better.

As of now, it still does not work... but I am working on it (digging the web for similar issues).
