## Release content

### A longer release

As explained in the last release notes, I am concentrating on a side project and the library
evolved mostly to support its development.

Also, other projects were started since interesting challenges were submitted over the last months.

### Asynchronous helpers

The library offers new helpers to handle promises the right way.

#### gpf.forEachAsync

When you need to iterate over an array but the callback function is asynchronous.

#### Interface wrappers

As described when introducing XML serialization, a way to insert custom promises while calling an interface
was necessary. This is done with...

### $singleton

As for $abstract, $singleton now allows to declare a class as

### Serialization attributes

#### gpf.serial

#### attributes restrictions

### Project metrics reporting

### Documentation of ESLint rules

## Lessons learned

Huge refactoring due to no-magic-numbers forced me to reconsider some of the patterns I was using regularly.
For instance:
`if (string.indexOf(otherString) === 0)`
was in fact
`if (string.startsWith(otherString))`

or
`if (string.indexOf(otherString) !== -1)`
was in fact
`if (string.includes(otherString))`

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/17) is not even defined.
For the next months, I will focus on a side project that requires all my attention.
