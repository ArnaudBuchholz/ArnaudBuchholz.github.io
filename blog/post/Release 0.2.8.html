## Release content

### A longer release

As explained in the [last release notes](http://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2018/08/release-027-quality-and-xml.html), I am
concentrating on a [side project](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-cms) and the library evolved to **support
its development**.

In the meantime, other projects ([mockserver-server](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/mockserver-server) and
[node-ui5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ui5)) were started since **interesting challenges** were
submitted over the last month. Not to mention that **more documentation** was requested on the linting rules but also on
the evolution of the library statistics.

As a consequence, this release took **more time than usual** (around 4 months).

### Asynchronous helpers

#### Interface wrappers

When the XML serialization was introduced, a [generic wrapper](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/272) was
**required to simplify** the use of the
[IXmlContentHandler interface](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IXmlContentHandler.html).

The new function
[gpf.interfaces.promisify](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.html#.promisify__anchor)
builds a **factory method** that takes an object implementing the given interface. This method returns a wrapper
exposing the interface methods but returning **chainable
[promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)**.

To put it in a nutshell, it converts this code:

`const
    writer = new gpf.xml.Writer(),
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableString();
gpf.stream.pipe(writer, output).then(() => {
    console.log(output.toString());
});
writer.startDocument()
    .then(() => writer.startElement("document"))
    .then(() => writer.startElement("a"))
    .then(() => writer.startElement("b"))
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.startElement("c"))
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.endDocument());`

into this code:

`const
    writer = new gpf.xml.Writer(),
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableString(),
    IXmlContentHandler = gpf.interfaces.IXmlContentHandler,
    xmlContentHandler = gpf.interfaces.promisify(IXmlContentHandler),
    promisifiedWriter = xmlContentHandler(writer);
gpf.stream.pipe(writer, output).then(() => {
    console.log(output.toString());
});
promisifiedWriter.startDocument()
    .startElement("document")
    .startElement("a")
    .startElement("b")
    .endElement()
    .endElement()
    .startElement("c")
    .endElement()
    .endElement()
    .endDocument();`

When using this wrapper, it quickly appeared that **something was missing**.
It sometimes happens that the chain is broken by a **normal promise**.
The wrapper was modified to deal with it.

`/*...*/
promisifiedWriter.startDocument()
    .startElement("document")
    .startElement("a")
    .startElement("b")
    .then(() => anyMethodReturningAPromise())
    .endElement()
    .endElement()
    .startElement("c")
    .endElement()
    .endElement()
    .endDocument();`

The best example of use is
[$metadata implementation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-cms/blob/77240f29513b359cd22ba15f46adfa5ad67be1b9/
api/metadata.js) of the side project.

#### gpf.forEachAsync

There are many [solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40328932/javascript-es6-promise-for-loop) to handle
**loops with promises**.

Since the library offers **iteration helpers**
([gpf.forEach](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.forEach__anchor)), it made sense to provide the
equivalent for asynchronous callback:
[gpf.forEachAsync](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.forEachAsync__anchor).
It obviously returns a promise **resolved when the loop is over**.

### $singleton

Among the [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern),
the **[singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)** is probably the most easy
to describe and implement.

Here again, there are many ways to implement a singleton in JavaScript.

In the library, an entity definition may include the
**[$singleton](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-DEFINE.html) property**.
When used, any attempt to create a new instance of the entity will return the same instance.

The singleton is allocated the **first time it is instantiated**.

For instance:
`var counter = 0,
    Singleton = gpf.define({
        $class: "mySingleton",
        $singleton: true,

        constructor: function () {
            this.value = ++counter;
        }
    });
var instance1 = new Singleton();
var instance2 = new Singleton();
assert(instance1.value === 1); // true
assert(instance2.value === 1); // true
assert(instance1 === instance2); // true`

### Serialization and validation attributes

A good way to describe these features is to start with the **use case**. As explained before, this release was made to
support the development of a side project. Simply put, it consists in a **JavaScript full stack** application composed
of:
* An [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/) interface
* A NodeJS server exposing an [ODATA](https://www.odata.org/) service

(...) There are many [UI frameworks](https://raygun.com/blog/popular-javascript-frameworks/) out there. I decided to go
with OpenUI5 for two reasons: the user interface is fairly simple and I want it to be responsive and look professional.
Furthermore, it comes with [OPA](https://youtu.be/HiZq-kuIbt0) that will allow - in this particular case - **end 2 end**
test automation.

Since I am a [lazy developer](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lazy-arnaud-buchholz/) building a backend on
top of [express](https://expressjs.com/), **flexibility** is mandatory so that adding a new entity / property **does not
imply changes all across the project**.

Indeed, a new property means that:
* The **[schema](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/overview/#MetadataForODataServices)** must be
updated so that the UI is aware of it
* **Serialization** *(reading from / writing to client)* must be adapted to handle the new property
* Depending on the property type, the value might be **converted** *(in particular for date/time)*

* It may *(or may not)* support **filtering / sorting**
* ...

#### gpf.attributes.Serializable

In this project, the main entity is a [Record](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-cms/blob/master/api/Record.js).

Since a class is defined to handle the instances, it makes sense to rely on its definition to determine what is exposed.
However, we might need a bit of control on **which members are exposed and how**.

This is a **perfect use case for attributes**.

The [gpf.attributes.Serializable](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.Serializable.html) attribute
**describes the name and type** as well as indicates if the property is required.

For instance, the [_name property](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-cms/blob/master/api/Record.js#L30)
is exposed as the string field named "name".

(...)  The required part is not yet leveraged but it will be used to validate the entities.

This definition is **documented** in the structure
[gpf.typedef.serializableProperty](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.typedef.html#.serializableProperty).

Today, only three [types](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.serial.html#.types__anchor) are supported:
* string
* integer
* date/time

#### gpf.serial

Once the members are flagged with the Serializable attribute, some helpers were created to **utilize this information**.

[gpf.serial.get](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.serial.html#.get__anchor) returns a dictionary
indexing the Serializable attributes per the class member name.

Also, two methods **convert/read the instance into/from a simpler object** containing only the serializable properties:
* [gpf.serial.fromRaw](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.serial.html#.fromRaw__anchor)
* [gpf.serial.toRaw](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.serial.html#.toRaw__anchor)

These methods include a converter callback **to enable value conversion**.

For instance:
`var raw = gpf.serial.toRaw(entity, (value, property) => {
  if (gpf.serial.types.datetime === property.type) {
    if (value) {
      return '/Date(' + value.getTime() + ')/'
    } else {
      return null
    }
  }
  if (property.name === 'tags') {
    return value.join(' ')
  }
  return value
})`

#### attributes restrictions

If you read carefully the documentation of the
[gpf.attributes.Serializable](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.Serializable.html) attribute,
you may notice the section named **Usage restriction**.

It mentions:
* Only for member level (see [gpf.attributes.MemberAttribute](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.MemberAttribute.html))
* Only once (see [gpf.attributes.UniqueAttribute](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.UniqueAttribute.html))

If you check the [code](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.8/src/attributes/serializable.js#L18):

`var _gpfAttributesSerializable = _gpfDefine({
    $class: "gpf.attributes.Serializable",
    $extend: _gpfAttribute,
    $attributes: [
      new _gpfAttributesMemberAttribute(),
      new _gpfAttributesUniqueAttribute()
    ],

    /* ... */`

This means that the Serializable attribute can be used only on class members and only once *(per class member)*.

This also means that **new attribute classes were designed to secure the use of attributes**. This will facilitate the
**adoption** of the mechanism since any **misuse of an attribute will generate an error**. It is a better approach than
having no effect and not letting the developer know.

The validation attributes are:

* [gpf.attributes.AttributeForInstanceOf](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.AttributeForInstanceOf.html)
which checks that the attribute is applied to the right class.
* [gpf.attributes.ClassAttribute](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.ClassAttribute.html) to
restrict the use of an attribute to the class level (i.e. in the $attributes entity property)
* [gpf.attributes.MemberAttribute](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.MemberAttribute.html) to
restrict the use of an attribute to a member
* [gpf.attributes.UniqueAttribute](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.UniqueAttribute.html) to
enforce the uniqueness of the attribute (including through inheritance)

(...) Actually, ClassAttribute, MemberAttribute and UniqueAttribute are singletons.

Obviously, **these attributes are also validated**, check their documentation and
[implementation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.8/src/attributes).

### Project metrics reporting

Two years ago, the [release 0.1.5 named "The new core"](http://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2016/12/release-015.html) marked the
beginning of **a new development start for the library**. There are few traces of what happened before as the project
was **not structured**. Since then, the project metrics were **systematically** added to the
[Readme](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#metrics).

With [release 0.2.3](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2017/12/release-023-streams-and-pipes.html), all these metrics were
**consolidated into one single file**:
[releases.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/build/releases.json). This file is **automatically
updated** by the [release script](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/release.js).

Using [chartist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/), the dashboard tiles were modified to render a chart
showing the **progression of the metrics over the releases**.

### Documentation of ESLint rules

#### Automated documentation

[Linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) is used to **statically validate the source code** since
the beginning of the project. The set of [eslint](https://eslint.org/) rules has been **refined over the releases** and
**critical settings** framed the way the sources look like.

Furthermore, the linter also evolves with time (and feedback) and **some rules become obsolete as new ones are
introduced**.

In the end, it is really challenging to **stay up-to-date** and provide **clear and complete explanations** on the
different rules that are configured (and why they are configured this way).

These are the problems that were addressed with the [task #280](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/280).

As a result, a [script](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/doc/linting.js) leverages
eslint's [rules documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) to **extract and validate** the library settings.
When needed, some [details](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/doc/linting) are provided.

The final result appears in the documentation in the
[Tutorials\Linting](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-LINTING.html) menu

#### no-magic-numbers

While documenting the rules, the [no-magic-numbers](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers) one stood out.

I wanted to understand how this rule would (could?) **improve the code**. It was enabled to see how many magic numbers
existed. Realizing that this generates a **huge amount of errors**, the check was turned off for test files
*(to start with)*.

(...) Some people like to distinguish warnings and errors. However warnings **do not call for action**. As a result,
they tend to last forever leading to the [broken window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) effect. I
prefer a binary approach meaning it is either OK or not OK.

It took almost one month of refactoring to remove them but, in the end, it did improve the code and lessons were
learned.

(...) This also demonstrated the value of having 100% of test coverage.

## Lessons learned

### Library + application

This may sound obvious but using the library as a support for an application gives **immediate feedback** on how the
**API is appropriate**. It helps to keep the focus on how practical the methods are.

For instance, the helper [gpf.serial.get](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.serial.html#.get__anchor) was
integrated in the library because its
[10 little lines of code](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.8/src/serial/get.js#L21) were repeated in
the application.

### Refactoring

It is not the first time that the whole library requires refactoring. And I actually **like the exercise** because it
gives the opportunity to **come back on old code** that hasn't been touched in a while. Since the project started
several years ago, my **knowledge and skill have evolved** and it gives a new look on the sources.
Furthermore, the code being fully tested, there are very **little risks**.

When dealing with [magic numbers](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers), I realized that some patterns were
**obsolete** because of JavaScript methods I was not used to. As the library offers a
[compatibility layer](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html), it has been enriched
with these new methods and the code modified consequently.

For instance:
`if (string.indexOf(otherString) === 0)`
is better replaced with:
`if (string.startsWith(otherString))`

The same way:
`if (string.indexOf(otherString) !== -1)`
should be using:
`if (string.includes(otherString))`

Last example,
[regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)
are widely used with **capturing groups**. Their value is available in the array-like result through indexes.
**Using constants rather than numbers to get these values improves the code readability**.

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/17) is not completely defined.
There are plans to expand **the use of attributes to ES6 classes** and to integrate
[graaljs](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs).

For the rest, it will depend on the side project since **it needs all my attention**.
