* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### A longer release

As explained in the [last release notes](http://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2018/08/release-027-quality-and-xml.html), I am
concentrating on a [side project](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-cms) and the library evolved to support
its development.

In the meantime, other projects ([mockserver-server](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/mockserver-server) and
[node-ui5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ui5)) were started since interesting challenges were
submitted over the last month. Not to mention that more documentation was requested on the linting rules but also on the
evolution of the library statistics.

As a consequence, this release took more time than usual (around 4 months).

### Asynchronous helpers

#### Interface wrappers

When the XML serialization was introduced, a [generic wrapper](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/272) was
required to simplify the use of the [IXmlContentHandler interface](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IXmlContentHandler.html).

known interfaces. But also, it is necessary to be able to chain these calls with custom handlers

The best example is the [metadata handler](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-cms/blob/77240f29513b359cd22ba15f46adfa5ad67be1b9/api/metadata.js)


The library offers new helpers to handle promises the right way.

#### gpf.forEachAsync

When mixing loops and promises, things can quickly become a mess
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40328932/javascript-es6-promise-for-loop

Since the library offers iteration helpers
([gpf.forEach](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.forEach__anchor)), it made sense to provide the
equivalent for asynchronous callbacks:
[gpf.forEachAsync](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.forEachAsync__anchor)

### $singleton

Among the design patterns, the [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is probably the most easy
to describe and implement. There are many ways to create a singleton in JavaScript.

I decided to go with the class property []$singleton](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-DEFINE.html)

### Serialization attributes

### Documentation of ESLint rules

https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-LINTING.html

Spent almost one monthn refactoring to enable no-magic-numbers !

## Lessons learned

Huge refactoring due to no-magic-numbers forced me to reconsider some of the patterns I was using regularly.
For instance:
`if (string.indexOf(otherString) === 0)`
was in fact
`if (string.startsWith(otherString))`

or
`if (string.indexOf(otherString) !== -1)`
was in fact
`if (string.includes(otherString))`

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/17) is not even defined.
For the next months, I will focus on a side project that requires all my attention.
