    The version 0.2.1 of the GPF-JS library delivers an HTTP request helper that can be used on all supported hosts.
    It was quite a challenge as it implied 5 different developments, here are the details.

<code class="markdown">

## The need for HTTP requests

Almost all modern applications are split in two distinct parts:
* The user interface where information is displayed and user input is received and processed
* A processing engine where data persistency and business logic are implemented

Sometimes those two parts are together on the same hardware, sometimes they are running on separate hosts.
For web applications, the UI is executed in the user browser and the engine runs in a web server.

Since [cloud platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cloud_platforms) became the new standard to
develop, deliver and maintain large scale applications, communication standard were stabilized to simplify data exchange
between the UI and the engine. At a broader scale, the engine itself might be broken down into several parts
([microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)).



This leads to overarching concepts such as:
* Representational state transfer ([REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) APIs
* [Web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)
* OData
* [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) (or [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing))
...

All the above concepts rely on a single layer to convery the message between the UI and the engine: the HTTP layer.

When the two communicate, the HTTP layer is : it abstracts the
HTTP offers [connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access)
and [Interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability) with virtually all systems of the internet.

### Evolution of HTTP requests in browsers

Before [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29) requests, web pages had to be fully refreshed to
reflect any change of the server state. From a user experience point of view, it was OK (mostly because we had no other
models) but this prevented the development of SPA.

Then AJAX appeared and this deeply modified the way web pages were developped: they were faster, crisper ..

The only problem was that each browser offered different way of doing those AJAX requests.

jQuery was initially designed to offer APIs that would work the same way on any browser.
Today, most modern libraries are focusing on one environment only. Otherwise, they deliver feature that work both in
    browsers and NodeJS.
In my case, I added three additional hosts: PhantomJS, WScript and Rhino.

## How to test HTTP request

When you follow the [TDD practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), you write tests before
writing any line of production code. But in that case, the first challenge was to figure out how the whole HTTP layer
could be tested. [Mocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) was not an option.

The project itself heavily relies on the [grunt connect](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) task to
deliver the dashboard: a place where you can access all the tools (source list, tests, documentation...).

![dashboard](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.6/homepage.png)

(...) As a lazy developper, I don't need any command line for my development, all the tools are available within the
dashboard.

Some middleware were also plugged to add extra features such as:
* [cache](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/cache.js): introduced with
[version 0.1.7](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/03/release-017.html), it is leveraged by the command line used to test
browsers when [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) is not available. It implements a data storing service similar to
[Redis](https://redis.io/).
* [fs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/fs.js): a file access service used
to read, create and delete files within the project storage.
* [grunt](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/grunt.js): a wrapper used to
generate and format the log of grunt tasks.

Based on this experience, I thought of another extension: the
[echo](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/echo.js) service.
It basically accepts any HTTP request and the response either reflects the request details or can be modified through
URL parameters.

Then, [POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/) was used to test the tool that will be used to test the HTTP layer...

![GET](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/echo%20test%20GET.png)

![GET 500](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/
echo%20test%20GET%20500.png)

![POST](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/echo%20test%20POST.png)

    ## The different environments

The GPF-JS library is a project I started almost three years ago. Initially, it was a playground to learn how a big

### NodeJS

Beside being a JavaScript host, NodeJS offers a complete set of API for the most common tasks.
In particular, it comes with the [http feature](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http).

Using the [http.request](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback) method, you can allocate
an [http.ClientRequest](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest).

### Browsers

AJAX request
    => network communication is handled by the browser
    => callback is triggered only when the engine is free

Older browsers had different ways to trigger requests. This is where jQuery became so usefull by encapsulating browser
differences inside a single API.

Most recent browsers offer the [XmlHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) object.

new XmlHttpRequest()

Building helpers _gpfHttpGenSetHeaders / _gpfHttpGenSend

### WScript

WScript offers the possibility to reuse [COM components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model).
In particular, the
[WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384106%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)

However, the object offers synchronous methods.

Helpers could be used but does not support bind (had to change the way helper is built)

### Rhino

One of the most challenging implementation because it relies on JAVA API.

JAVA + Streams

new java.net.URL(request.url).openConnection();

If a status code 5 comes back from the server, the response stream differs.
This is handled specifically as the API has to succeed no matter what

### PhantomJS

PhantomJS is a command line simulating a browser...
