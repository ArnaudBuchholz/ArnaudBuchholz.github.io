<code class="markdown">

## The need for HTTP requests

In a world of [interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability),
[internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) and
[microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), the - almost 30 years old -
[HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) defines a communication foundation that is
widely known and implemented.

Originally designed for human-to-machine communication, this protocol also supports machine-to-machine communication
through standardized concepts and interfaces:
* Representational state transfer APIs ([REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer))
* [Web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)
* [OData](http://www.odata.org/)
* [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) (or [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing))
* ...

### Evolution of HTTP requests in browsers

[Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) were the first applications implementing this protocol to
access the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).

![Netscape communicator loading screen](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/netscape%20communicator.png)

Before [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29) was conceptualized, web pages had to be fully
refreshed from the server to reflect any change. JavaScript was used for simple client manipulations.
From a user experience point of view, it was OK (mostly because we had
no other choices) but this limited the development of user interfaces.

![I guess](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/I%20guess.jpg)

Then AJAX introduced new ways to design web pages: only the new information could be fetched from the server without
reloading the page. Therefore, the pages were faster, crisper and fully asynchronous.

However, each browser had its own implementation of AJAX requests *(not mentioning DOM, event handling and other
incompatibilities)*. And that's why [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), which was initially designed to offer a uniform API
that would work identically on any browser, became so popular.

![jQuery everywhere](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/jQuery%20everywhere.jpg)

Today, the situation has changed: almost all browsers are implementing the same APIs and, consequently, modern
libraries are considering browsers to be one environment only.

### GPF-JS

[GPF-JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js) obviously supports browsers and it leverages AJAX requests to implement
HTTP requests in this environment.
But the library is also compatible with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) as well as other - less common - command line
hosts:
* [cscript/wscript](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490887.aspx)
* [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

Designing only one API that is compatible with all these hosts means to deal with each host specificities.

## How to test HTTP request

When you follow the [TDD practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), you write tests before
writing any line of production code. But in that case, the first challenge was to figure out how the whole HTTP layer
could be tested. [Mocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) was not an option.

The project development environment heavily relies on the
[grunt connect](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) task to deliver the dashboard: a place where
the developer can access all the tools (source list, tests, documentation...).

![dashboard](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.6/homepage.png)

(...) As a lazy developer, I just need one command line for my development (grunt).
Then all the tools are available within the dashboard.

Some middleware is plugged to add extra features such as:
* [cache](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/cache.js): introduced with
[version 0.1.7](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/03/release-017.html), it is leveraged by the command line used to test
browsers when [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) is not available. It implements a data storing service like
[Redis](https://redis.io/).
* [fs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/fs.js): a file access service used
to read, create and delete files within the project storage. For instance, it is used by the sources tile to check if a
source has a corresponding test file.
* [grunt](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/grunt.js): a wrapper used to
execute and format the log of grunt tasks.

Based on this experience, it became obvious that the project needed another extension: the
[echo](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/echo.js) service.
It basically accepts any HTTP request and the response either reflects the request details or can be modified through
URL parameters.

[POSTMAN](https://www.getpostman.com/) was used to test the tool that will be used to test the HTTP layer...

![GET](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/echo%20test%20GET.png)

![GET 500](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/
echo%20test%20GET%20500.png)

![POST](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/echo%20test%20POST.png)

## One API to rule them all

Now that the HTTP layer can be tested, the API must be designed to write the tests.

### Input

An HTTP request starts with some parameters:
* The [Uniform Resource Locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) which determines the web address you want to send
the request to. There are several ways to specify this location: NodeJS offers an
[URL class](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_url) which exposes the different parts of it (host, port ...).
However, the simplest representation remains the one everybody is used to: the string you can read inside the browser
location bar.

* The [request method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) (also known as verb)
which specifies the kind of action you want to execute.

* An optional list of [header fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields) meant to
configure the request processing *(such as specifying the expected answer type...)*.
The simplest way to provide this list is to use a key/value dictionary, meaning an
[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object).

* The [request body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_message_body), mostly used for POST and PUT actions, which
contains that data to upload to the server. Even if the library supports the concept of
[streams](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/gpf.interfaces.IWritableStream.html), most of the expected use
cases imply sending an envelope that is synchronously built (text, JSON, XML...). Also, JavaScript (in general) is not
good at handling binary data, hence a simple string is expected as a request body.

This leads to the definition of the
[httpRequestSettings](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/gpf.typedef.html#.httpRequestSettings) type.

### Output

On completion, the server sends back a [response](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html) composed of:
* A [status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) that provides feedback about how the server
processed the request. Typically, 200 means everything went well. On the contrary, 4xx messages signal an error and 500
is a critical server error.

* A list of response headers. For instance, this is how [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) are
transmitted by the server to the client (and, actually, they are also sent back by the client to the server
through headers).

* The response body: depending on what has been requested, it will contain the server answer.
This response could be deserialized using a
[readable stream](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/gpf.interfaces.IReadableStream.html). But, for the same
reasons, a simple string containing the whole response text will be returned.

This leads to the definition of the
[httpRequestResponse](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/gpf.typedef.html#.httpRequestResponse) type.

(...) If needed, the API may evolve later to introduce the possibility to use streams.

### Waiting for the completion

An HTTP request is asynchronous; hence the client must wait for the server to answer.
To avoid the [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/), a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) is used to
represent the eventual completion of the request.

This leads to the definition of the
[gpf.http.request](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/gpf.http.html#.request) API.

The promise is
[resolved](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve) when the
server answered, whatever the status code
(including [500](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500)). The only way the promise would be rejected is when something wrong happened
during communication.

### Shortcuts

For simple requests, such as a GET with no specific header, the API must be easy to use.
Shortcuts are defined to shorten the call, for instance:

`
gpf.http.get(baseUrl).then(function (response) {
    process(response.responseText);
}, handleError);
`

See the [documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/gpf.http.html).

## Handling different environments

Inside the library, there are almost as many implementations as there are supported hosts.
Each one is inside a self-titled file below the
[http source folder](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/src/http).
This will be detailed right after.

Consequently, there are basically many ways to call the proper implementation depending on the host:

* Inside the request API, create an if / else condition that checks every possibility
`gpf.http.request = function (/*...*/) {
    if (_GPF_HOST.NODEJS === _gpfHost) {
        // call NodeJS implementation
    } else if (_GPF_HOST.BROWSER === _gpfHost) {
        // call Browser implementation
    } else /* ... */
};`

* Have a global variable receiving the proper implementation, using an if condition inside each implementation file
`// Inside src/host/nodejs.js
if (_GPF_HOST.NODEJS === _gpfHost) {
    _gpfHttpRequestImpl = function (/*...*/) {
        /* ... NodeJS implementation ... */
    };
}

// Inside src/http.js
gpf.http.request = function (/*...*/) {
    _gpfHttpRequestImpl(/*...*/);
};`

* Create a dictionary indexing all implementations per host and then fetch the proper one on call
`// Inside src/host/nodejs.js
_gpfHttpRequestImplByHost[_GPF_HOST.NODEJS] = function () {
    /* ... NodeJS implementation ... */
};

// Inside src/http.js
gpf.http.request = function (/*...*/) {
    _gpfHttpRequestImplByHost[_gpfHost](/*...*/);
};`


My preference goes to the last choice for the following reasons:
* if / else conditions generate [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity).
In general, the less if the better. In this case, they are useless because used to compare a variable (here
the current host) with a list of predefined values (the list of host names). A dictionary is more efficient.

* It is simpler to manipulate a dictionary to dynamically declare a new host or even update an existing implementation.
Indeed, we could imagine a plugin mechanism that would change the way requests are working by replacing the default
handler.

Consequently, the internal library variable
[_gpfHttpRequestImplByHost](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.1/src/http.js#L48-L67) contains all
implementations indexed by host name. The request API calls the proper one by fetching the implementation at runtime.

### Browsers

As explained in the introduction, browsers offer AJAX requests to make HTTP Requests. This is possible through the
[XmlHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) JavaScript class.

(...) There is one major restriction when dealing with AJAX requests. You are mainly limited to the server you are
currently browsing. If you try to access a different server (or even a different port on the same server), then you are
entering the realm of [cross-origin requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS).

If needed, you will find many examples on the web on
[how to use it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest).
Long story short, you can trigger a simple AJAX request in 5 lines of code.

In terms of processing, it is interesting to note that, once triggered from the JavaScript code, the network
communication is fully handled by the browser: it does not require the JavaScript engine.
This means that the page may execute some code while the request is being transmitted to the server as well as while
waiting for the response.
However, to be able to process the result (i.e. trigger the callback), the JavaScript engine must be idle.

![Test preview](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/browser.png)

Browser implementation is done inside
[src/http/xhr.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/http/xhr.js).

Two external helpers are defined inside
[src/http/helpers.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/http/helpers.js):
* [_gpfHttpGenSetHeaders](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.1/src/http/helpers.js#L31-L47)
* [_gpfHttpGenSend](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.1/src/http/helpers.js#L49-L65)

Setting the request headers and sending request data are almost done the same way for three hosts.
To avoid [code duplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), those two functions generates
specialized versions capable of calling host specific methods.

### NodeJS

Besides being a JavaScript host, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) comes with a complete
[set of API](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) for a wide variety of tasks.
Specifically, it comes with the [http feature](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http).

But unlike AJAX requests, triggering an HTTP requests requires more effort than in a browser.

The [http.request](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback) method allocates
an [http.ClientRequest](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest).
However, it expects a structure that details the web address.
That's why the
[URL parsing API](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_parse_urlstring_parsequerystring_slashesdenotehost) is needed.

The clientRequest object is also a [writable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable)
and it exposes the method to push data over the connection. Things being done at the lowest level, you are
responsible of ensuring the consistency of the request details. Indeed, it is mandatory to set the request headers
properly. For instance, forgetting the
[Content-Length specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length) on a PUSH or
a PUT will lead to the HPE_UNEXPECTED_CONTENT_LENGTH error.
The library is taking care of that part.

The same way, the response body is a [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable).
Fortunately, GPF-JS provides a
[NodeJS-specific stream reader](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/stream/nodejs.js#L103-L158) and
it deserializes the content inside a string
using [_gpfStringFromStream](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/string/fromStream.js).

![Test preview](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/nodejs.png)

NodeJS implementation is done inside
[src/http/nodejs.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/http/nodejs.js).

### WScript

WScript is the scripting host available on almost all post Windows XP Microsoft Windows operating systems.
It comes in two flavors:
* **WScript.exe** which is showing outputs in dialog boxes
* **cscript.exe** which is the command line counter part

This host has a rather old and weird support of the JavaScript features. It does not supports
[timers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) but GPF-JS provides
all the necessary [polyfills](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html) to compensate
for the missing APIs.

Despite all these troubles, it has one unique advantage over the other hosts: it offers the possibility to
manipulate [COM components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model).

Indeed, the host-specific class
[ActiveXObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/activexobject-object-javascript) gives
you access to thousands of external features within a script:
* file access, like in
[wscript's IFileStorage implementation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/fs/wscript.js)
* xml parsers ([DOM and SAX](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6828703/what-is-the-difference-between-sax-and-dom))
* [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation)
* Office applications (outlook, word, excel...)
* ...

(...) For instance, few years ago, I created a script capable of reconfiguring a virtual host to fit user
preferences and make it unique on the network.

Among the list of [available objects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3239610/standard-activexobject-refrence-list),
there is one that is used to generate HTTP requests: the
[WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384106%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
object.

Basically, it mimics the interface of the XmlHttpRequest object with one significant difference: its behavior is
synchronous. As the GPF API returns a Promise, the developer does not have to care about this difference.

![Test preview](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/cscript.png)

Wscript implementation is done inside
[src/http/wscript.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/http/wscript.js).

### Rhino

[Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino) is probably one of the most challenging - and
fun - environment because it is based on [java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/).

The fascinating aspect of Rhino comes from the tight integration between the two languages. Indeed, the JavaScript
engine is implemented in java and you can access any java class from JavaScript.
In terms of language support, it is almost the same than WScript: no timers and written on a relatively old
specification. Here again, the polyfills are taking care of filling the blanks.

To implement HTTP requests, one have to figure out which part of the java platform would be used. After doing some
investigations (thanks [Google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=java+http+request)), the solution appeared to be the
[java.net.URL](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/net/URL.html) class.

Like NodeJS, java streams are used to send or receive data over the connection. Likewise, the library offers
[rhino-specific streams implementation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/stream/rhino.js).

(...) Stream reading works by consuming bytes. To read text, a
[java.util.Scanner](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.1/src/stream/rhino.js#L93-L94) instance is used.

Surprisingly, if the status code is in the 5xx range, then
[getting the response stream](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.1/src/http/rhino.js#L32-L38) will fail
and you have to go with the error stream.

![Test preview](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/rhino.png)

Rhino implementation is done inside
[src/http/rhino.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/http/rhino.js).

### PhantomJS

To put it in a nutshell, [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) is a command line simulating a browser. It is mainly used
to script access to web sites and it is the perfect tool for
[test automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation).

But there are basically two styles of PhantomJS scripts:
* On one hand, it browses a website and simulates what would happen in a browser
* On the other hand, it is a command line executing some JavaScript code

As a matter of fact, GPF-JS uses those two ways:
* [mocha](https://github.com/kmiyashiro/grunt-mocha) is used to automate browser testing with PhantomJS
* a dedicated [command line](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/phantomjs.js) runs the
test suite without any web page

As a result, in this environment, the XmlHttpRequest JavaScript class is available.

However, like in a browser, this host is also subject to security concerns.
Hence you are not allowed to request a server that is not the one being opened.

Luckily, you can bypass this constraint using a command line parameter:
[--web-security=false](http://phantomjs.org/api/command-line.html).

![Test preview](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/phantomjs.png)

PhantomJS implementation is done inside
[src/http/xhr.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/http/xhr.js).

## Conclusion

If you survived the whole article, congratulations *(and sorry for the broken English)*.

Now you might be wondering...

![What's the point?](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
5%20ways%20to%20make%20an%20http%20request/whats%20the%20point.jpg)

Actually, this kind of challenge satisfies [my curiosity](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-arnaud-buchholz).
I learned a lot by implementing this feature and, actually, it was immediately applied to greatly [improve the coverage
measurement](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/06/release-021-side-project-support.html).

Indeed, each host is tested with instrumented files and the collected coverage data is serialized to be later consolidated
and reported on. However, as of today, only two hosts supports file storage: NodeJS and WScript.
But thanks to the HTTP support, all hosts are
[sending the coverage data](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/loader.js#L187-L197) to the
fs middleware so that it generates the file.
