    So you have been writing a nice and helpful piece of library and you want to move it to GitHub to expose it to the
    world. Here is a list of things to consider before jumping into this wild adventure.

## Setting the expectations

First of all, let's talk about the obvious benefits of using [GitHub](https://github.com/):
* your code is in a safe location
* it is shared immediately: everyone can see your changes
* you have branching & merging features
* the website offers interesting statistics on your project
* you have an inbuilt

However, the code is public by default. If you want to

## The project itself

Need to talk about
    - Code quality
    - Code testing
    - Code sharing / how people may contribute to the project

Building a reusable package:
    - npm for node
    - bower for browser

    Hi Rick,

    I thought about it over the week-end (by the way, I hope you had a happy Easter) and I finally came back to one single question. It may sound silly but this is actually a key one to decide if and how we move on: what do you expect from putting your project on GitHub?

    The reasons why I am asking this are the following:
    - On GitHub, projects are public to everyone unless you pay a subscription. If you go for a paid subscription, I guess you want to make money out of your library. If you don't, it means anybody can look into your code and may copy / steal from it.
    - The number of GitHub projects is huge and it is extremely difficult to improve your visibility until people start adopting your code. Are you planning to have more tools / library / applications leveraging this library?
    - GitHub is a source repository, it is rarely used to distribute the code. As far as I understood from your message, you also want to put your code on NPM. However, NPM is node-centric and I believe you want to address browser challenges. Maybe you should plan a bower integration.
    - If you want to benefit from the collaborative platform, your project needs to be well structured, documented *and* tested. This is usually an extra effort that pays back on the long term only.
    - Do you have a timeline?

    Regards,
    -	Arnaud
