    This short article summarizes how Travis CI was plugged into the GPF-JS GitHub repository
    to assess quality on every push.
</div>
<code class="markdown">

## Quality control

Since the beginning of the [GPF-JS](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) project,
[quality](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#metrics) is a high priority topic.

Over the years, a complete development and testing framework has been built:
* Development follows **TDD** principles
* The **code is linted** with eslint *(also with jshint, even if it is redundant)*

* The **maintainability ratio** is computed using [plato](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plato) and
**verified through custom threshold** values
* **Testing is done with all supported hosts**
* The **coverage level** is measured and controlled with custom threshold values
* A **web dashboard** displays the metrics and gives access to the tools

However, these validations were done locally and they had to be **run manually before pushing the code**.

In order to **enable collaboration** and ensure that all pull requests would go to the same **validation process**,
a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) platform was required.

Another approach consists in creating [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/gr/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to force the
quality assessment before pushing. However, it requires the submitting platform to be properly configured.
Having a central place where all the tests are being run **guarantees the correct and unbiased execution of the tests**.

## Travis CI

[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a **free solution** that integrates smoothly with
[GitHub](https://github.com/). Actually, the **GitHub credentials are used to login** to the platform.

After authentication, all the repositories are made available to Travis and each one can be enabled **individually**.

![Documented steps](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Travis%20integration/steps.png)

The selected repositories must be **[configured](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started)** to
instruct Travis on **how the builds are done**. To put it in a nutshell, a new file *(.travis.yml)* must be added.

Once everything is put together, the platform will **monitor pushes and trigger builds automatically**. As a result,
it documents the push in GitHub with a flag indicating if the build succeeded.

![Successful builds](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Travis%20integration/push%20validation.png)

When opening the Travis website, the user is welcomed with a nice **dashboard listing the enabled repositories with
their respective status**.

The [project README](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/README.md) can be modified to show
the [last build result](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#gpf-library) using an image delivered by the Travis
infrastructure:

## Changes in GPF-JS

### .travis.yml

The *.yml* extension stands for **[YAML file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)**: a structured format that is
commonly used for configuration files. In the context of Travis, it describes the **requirements and steps to buid and
validate** the project.

#### Requirements

One obvious requirement of the [GPF-JS](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml) development
environment is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). This is configured by defining the [language setting](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L1) and selecting the [Long Term Support](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L2-L3) version.

Chrome is also [required](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L5) to enable browser
testing.

[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) is installed using the [proper command line](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L6).

The remaining requirements are described by the [project dependencies](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
gpf-js/blob/f0e1d5a5cd48820d65754f21864e2e0a642cf3be/package.json#L24-L63) and are [installed](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L7) through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

#### Steps

The default step being executed by Travis is `npm test`

The resulting commmand line is specified in the
[package.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/package.json#L11) file; it executes **grunt** with
the following tasks:
* **connectIf** to setup a local web server necessary for browser and [gpf.http](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.http.html) testing
* **concurrent:source** to execute all tests with the source version (see [library testing
tutorial](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-TESTME.html))

But, first,  **the GPF-JS development environment requires a configuration file** to be generated: it contains the list
of detected hosts, the metrics tresholds and the HTTP port to be used to serve files.

### Configuration

The configuration file is **interactively created the very first time the grunt command is being executed**.
Indeed, the user input is expected to approve or change some values (such as the HTTP port).

![Grunt config](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Travis%20integration/grunt%20config.png)

However, on Travis, no user can answer the questions. Hence, the tool has to be fully automatic.

When grunt is triggered, the [gruntfile.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.3/gruntfile.js#L17)
first checks if any configuration file already exist. If not, a **default task takes place to run the
[configuration tool](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/config.js)**.

To support Travis, this default task processing was isolated in a folder of ['first-launch' configuration
tasks](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/grunt/config). The name of the file is used
to name the task.

The configuration tool was then modified to handle a so-called **quiet mode** and the
[Travis configuration task](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/config/travis.js) leverages this
option. Additionally, **the task also executes the quality tasks** (linters, plato & coverage).

So, the command [grunt travis](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L8) is executed before
the testing step to ensure the existence of the configuration file.

### Challenges

After figuring out the different steps, a long debugging session - *mostly composed of try and fail cycles* - was
required to figure out the specificities of the platform.

The history of pushes on the [Travis integration issue](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/218)
illustrates all the attemps that were made.

#### Non-Windows environment

The very first issue was related to the environment itself. The development being made on Windows, the library has never
been tested with a different operating system before.

Travis offers the possibility to [use different flavors](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-os/) but the
**default one is Linux**.

As a consequence, some scripts were adapted to handle the differences in the **path separator** (for
[instance](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/3e6bab7b65e7606f4ef507539ad468167f643d7d)).

(...) NodeJS is capable of absorbing those differences. This is the reason why the library uses the / as a path
separator but is capable of translating back to \ when running on Windows-specific host.

#### Browser testing

Another issue was related to browser testing. As a matter of fact, **the Travis environment does not provide any
graphical user interface** by default. This being said, it means that you can't start a browser.

Fortunately, this is explained in the [Travis documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/
gui-and-headless-browsers/) where several options are proposed.

And, luckily, the **GPF-JS development environment provides an [alternate way](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/
blob/master/doc/tutorials/TESTME.md#command-line-browser-testing) to test browsers**.

Consequently, the [headless mode of chrome is used](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
f8771cba9b121d221983bf236840a014c98430f1/make/config.js#L161-L165).

#### Wscript is missing

Last but not least, the operating system being Linux, the [Microsoft Scripting Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/
previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490887%28v=technet.10%29) is not available.



Impact on coverage, add flags to coverage

This part will change: the files should be tagged with host info so that coverage would know (based on detected hosts)
    if it was possible to run

    NodeJS was used to simulate WScript environment


### Bonus: coverage with coveralls
