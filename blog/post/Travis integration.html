    This short article summarizes how Travis CI was plugged into the GPF-JS GitHub repository
    to assess quality on each push.

## Quality control

Since the beginning of the GPF-JS project, quality is a high priority topic.

Over the years, a complete testing framework has been built to serve this idea:
* Development follow **TDD** principles
* The **code is linted** with jshint and eslint
* The **maintainability ratio** is computed using plato and **verified through custom treshold** values
* **Testing is done over all supported platforms**
* The **coverage level** is controlled with custom treshold values
* A **web dashboard** displays the metrics and gives access to the tools

However, these validations are done locally and they must be **run manually before pushing the code**.

In order to support collaboration and ensure all pull requests would go to the same validation process,
a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) process is required.

## Travis CI

[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a free continuous integration platform which integrates with GitHub
