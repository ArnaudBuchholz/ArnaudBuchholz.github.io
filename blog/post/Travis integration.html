    This short article summarizes how Travis CI was plugged into the GPF-JS GitHub repository
    to assess quality on every push.

## Quality control

Since the beginning of the [GPF-JS](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) project,
[quality](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#metrics) is a high priority topic.

Over the years, a complete testing framework has been built:
* Development follow **TDD** principles
* The **code is linted** with jshint and eslint
* The **maintainability ratio** is computed using [plato](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plato) and
**verified through custom threshold** values
* **Testing is done over all supported hosts**
* The **coverage level** is also measured and controlled with custom threshold values
* A **web dashboard** displays the metrics and gives access to the tools

However, these validations were done locally and they had to be **run manually before pushing the code**.

In order to **enable collaboration** and ensure all pull requests would go to the same **validation process**,
a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) platform was required.

## Travis CI

[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a **free solution** that integrates smoothly with
[GitHub](https://github.com/). Actually, the **GitHub credentials are used to login** to the platform.

Once authenticated, all the repositories are made available and each one can be enabled **individually**.

![](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Travis%20integration/steps.png)

The selected repositories must be [configured](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started) to
instruct Travis on **how the builds must be done**. To put it in a nutshell, a new file *(.travis.yml)* must be added.

When everything is put together, the platform will **monitor pushes and trigger builds automatically**. It also offers a
nice dashboard to monitor the enabled projects.

Finally, the [project README](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/README.md) can be modified to show
the [last build result](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#gpf-library):

## Changes in GPF-JS

### .travis.yml

### Generation of the configuration file

Default configurations, quiet mode for the setup, grunt travis

### Wscript is missing

Impact on coverage, add flags to coverage

This part will change: the files should be tagged with host info so that coverage would know (based on detected hosts)
    if it was possible to run

### Chrome testing

No selenium (but it might be possible to enable it)

    Luckily, I implemented the alternative to execute a command line
    google-chrome-stable
    Finding the right command line options
