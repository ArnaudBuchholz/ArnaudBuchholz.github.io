    This short article summarizes how Travis CI was plugged into the GPF-JS GitHub repository
    to assess quality on every push.

## Quality control

Since the beginning of the [GPF-JS](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) project,
[quality](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#metrics) is a high priority topic.

Over the years, a complete development and testing framework has been built:
* Development follow **TDD** principles
* The **code is linted** with jshint and eslint
* The **maintainability ratio** is computed using [plato](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plato) and
**verified through custom threshold** values
* **Testing is done over all supported hosts**
* The **coverage level** is also measured and controlled with custom threshold values
* A **web dashboard** displays the metrics and gives access to the tools

However, these validations were done locally and they had to be **run manually before pushing the code**.

In order to **enable collaboration** and ensure that all pull requests would go to the same **validation process**,
a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) platform was required.

## Travis CI

[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a **free solution** that integrates smoothly with
[GitHub](https://github.com/). Actually, the **GitHub credentials are used to login** to the platform.

Once authenticated, all the repositories are made available to Travis and each one can be enabled **individually**.

![Documented steps](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Travis%20integration/steps.png)

The selected repositories must be [configured](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started) to
instruct Travis on **how the builds must be done**. To put it in a nutshell, a new file *(.travis.yml)* must be added.

When everything is put together, the platform will **monitor pushes and trigger builds automatically**. It also offers a
nice dashboard to review the enabled repositories.

Finally, the [project README](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/README.md) can be modified to show
the [last build result](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#gpf-library):

## Changes in GPF-JS

<a name="todo">&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;</a>

### .travis.yml

The *.yml* extension stands for **[YAML file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)**: a format that is commonly used for
configuration files. In the context of Travis, it describes the **requirements and steps to buid and validate** the
project.

#### Requirements

One obvious requirement of the [GPF-JS](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml) development
environment is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). This is configured by defining the [language setting](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L1) and selecting the [Long Term Support](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L2-L3) version.

Chrome is also [requested](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L5) to enable browser
testing.

[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) is installed using the [proper command line](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L6).

Finally, anything else is described by the [project dependencies](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
1fb978e9b39e095f564c194f4329dba769f48146/package.json#L24-L61) and is [installed](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L7) through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

#### Configuration

The default script being executed by Travis is `npm test`

This standard test command is specified in the
[package.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/package.json#L11) file.

But, first,  the GPF-JS development environment requires a configuration file to be generated: it contains the list of
detected hosts, the metrics tresholds and the HTTP port to be used to serve files.

Normally, this configuration file is interactively created the very first time the grunt command is being executed.

![Grunt config](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Travis%20integration/grunt%20config.png).

On Travis, it has to be fully automatic.
This is why, a [specific grunt command](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.travis.yml#L8) was
designed to generate the proper configuration file.

### Generation of the configuration file

When grunt is triggered, the [gruntfile.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.3/gruntfile.js#L17) first
 checks if any configuration file exists. If not, a default configuration
is created and executed. It triggers make\config.js, the script responsible for configuration.

This step is fully interactive:
(screenshot)

To automate this part, a new mode was added: it is triggered by using grunt travis.

(...) The possibility was kept to define other configuration steps by creating files under grunt\config

### Chrome testing

No selenium (but it might be possible to enable it)

Luckily, I implemented the alternative to execute a command line
google-chrome-stable

Finding the right command line options was quite a challenge but finally got it

### Wscript is missing

Impact on coverage, add flags to coverage

This part will change: the files should be tagged with host info so that coverage would know (based on detected hosts)
    if it was possible to run

    NodeJS was used to simulate WScript environment

### Bonus: coverage with coveralls
