## Release content

### Sporadic Travis issues

From time to time, the **Travis continuous integration build was failing** with a message indicating that the
**coverage information was missing for the browser**. Here is
[a recent example](https://travis-ci.org/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/builds/367614025#L693).

I was first suspecting the **concurrent execution of quality checks** to be the root cause of the issue.
I disabled it but, still, the problem persisted.

So, I took a closer look on how the coverage information was generated while executing tests in the browser.

In the Travis environment, **chrome is spawned as a command line** with options to disable user interface.
When the tests are completed, an AJAX request is triggered to **save the tests results** through the
[cache middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/cache.js).
In the meantime a command line, responsible of spawning the browser, **[waits for the cache to be updated before closing
the process](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/test/host/browser.js#L22-L48)**.

Also, the test page is responsible of **saving the coverage information** through another AJAX request that goes to [fs
middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/fs.js).

I realized that the sequence was incorrect: the tests results were sent **before** the coverage information.
The two steps are now executed in the [correct order](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/
accc6830d5b29af93c734df5b63af082e2cef8ad#diff-1db347236fe2e62038c9d9829be1b967).

### Improved gpf.require namespace

The [modularization helper](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/01/my-own-require-implementation.html) was **improved**
following the feedback obtained after the first use:

* Errors are **better [documented](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/241)** to help the developer figure
what went wrong and where
* Loaded files now **[appear inside the browser debugger](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/244)**.
The trick consisted in augmenting the file content with a
[SourceURL information](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)

### gpf.require.js

#### Flavor specification

In the previous version, the [dependency wheel](https://github.com/fzaninotto/DependencyWheel) was added to the source
tile to give a visual representation of the **dependencies**. Also, each source file has been documented with 'tags'
qualifying the **feature** or the **host** the source relates to.

![Sources without any flavor selection](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/
sources%20before%20flavor.png)

Also, in the previous version, a **syntax was initiated** to instruct, in a readable way, which sources should be kept
for a given **flavor**. Combining the features list, hosts specification and dependencies, an
[algorithm - not my proudest one -](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/make/flavor.js) is capable of
generating an array of booleans **filtering the list of sources**.

![Example of flavor syntax](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/flavor.png)

As a result, the list of sources is **reduced to meet the flavor specification**.

![Sources with a flavor selection](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/
sources%20after%20flavor.png)

Everything was ready to setup the [require flavor specification](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/make/flavor/require.json), it contains:
* The **version in which the flavor was introduced**: it is required to build the versions table in the
[readme page](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#versions)
* The **flavor filter string**
* The tests required to **validate the flavor**
* A functional description of the flavor: it will be used to document flavors *(not yet implemented)*

* A technical description of the exposed API: the goal is to narrow down the list of namespaces / methods that are
**exposed** by the flavor *(not yet implemented)*

#### Reducing flavor size

The very first results were **quite disappointing**:

* NodeJS implementation of require depended on [gpf.fs](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.fs.html),
**almost the whole library was included**
([gpf.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.define__anchor),
[gpf.interfaces](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.html),
[gpf.stream](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.html), ...). So I decided to **isolate**
[gpf.fs.read](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.fs.html#.read__anchor) into
a [smaller read feature](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.read__anchor).

* The same way, Browser implementation of require depends on
[gpf.http](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.fs.html) to load the resource content. This namespace offers
a [mocking helper](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.http.html#.mock__anchor) that is **not needed**
for require. The code had to be **drastically changed** to successfully unplug this source.

#### Testing the flavor

There is no way the flavor could be officially released without making sure **it works as expected**. Luckily, the whole
library is already **100% tested**. Since the flavor description lists the test files to run, the development
framework was altered to **support a flavor parameter** that:
* loads the [flavor output file](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/build/gpf-require.js)
* loads and executes the necessary test files

Mostly, the following files were modified:
* [test/host/web_loader.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/test/host/web_loader.js#L168-L185):
as it takes care of browsers tests execution
* [test/host/loader.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/test/host/loader.js#L383-L398): as it takes
care of the other - command line type - hosts
* [grunt/exec.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/grunt/exec.js): it declares all the
[exec:test](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-TESTME.html) tasks
* [grunt/concurrent.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/grunt/concurrent.js): it creates tasks to
run all tests for a given version or flavor

Obviously, the [grunt make task](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/grunt/tasks/make.js#L24-L28) that
schedules all the tasks required to build the version was also modified.

## Lessons learned

Creating this first flavor was quite an **interesting challenge** and it took **longer than expected**.
It forced me to **rethink the way the code is articulated**, especially with regards to host specific implementations.

The original pattern consisted in **dictionaries** containing operations indexed by host name.
However, this had a major drawback: every time it was accessed, it was uselessly **impacting the performances** and
**producing complex code**.

Now, when appropriate, a new helper is introduced to define the proper implementation depending on the host.

Here is the [gpf.http](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.fs.html) use case:
* [_gpfHttpSetRequestImplIf](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/src/http.js#L46-L60) sets the
http request method if the provided host matches the detected one
* NodeJS' implementation [call](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/src/http/nodejs.js#L79)

Regarding [gpf.http.mock](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.http.html#.mock__anchor), I decided to
[plug it in the gpf.http implementation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/
blob/v0.2.6/src/http/mock.js#L160-L171) only when loaded, improving its **modularity**.

All this work paid, the [maintainability ratio](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/plato/index.html) **increased**
to 82.22.

One last thing, the require flavor supports only **'modern' browsers** meaning the ones where the **compatibility layer
is not required**. However, as of now, the development framework does not distinguish the configured browsers.

A configuration [will be defined](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/261).

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/15) is not yet clearly defined.
Since I will participate to [UICon'18](https://openui5.org/ui5con/) as a presenter, I will first focus on delivering a
good presentation.

I expect to work again on the library **after** June.
