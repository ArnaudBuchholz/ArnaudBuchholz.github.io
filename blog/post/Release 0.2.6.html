## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/14?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.6)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Sporadic Travis issues

From time to time, the **Travis continuous integration build was failing** with a message indicating that the
**coverage information was missing for the browser**. Here is
[a recent example](https://travis-ci.org/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/builds/367614025#L693).

I was first suspecting the **concurrent execution of quality checks** to be the root cause of the issue.
I disabled it but, still, the problem persisted.

So, I took a closer look on how the coverage information was generated while executing tests in the browser.

In the Travis environment, **chrome is spawned as a command line** with options to disable user interface.
When the tests are completed, an AJAX request is triggered to **save the tests results** through the
[cache middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/cache.js).
In the meantime a command line, responsible of spawning the browser, **[waits for the cache to be updated before closing
the process](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/test/host/browser.js#L22-L48)**.

Also, the test page is responsible of **saving the coverage information** through another AJAX request that goes to [fs
middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/fs.js).

I realized that the sequence was incorrect: the tests results were sent **before** the coverage information.
The two steps are now executed in the [correct order](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/
accc6830d5b29af93c734df5b63af082e2cef8ad#diff-1db347236fe2e62038c9d9829be1b967).

### Improved gpf.require namespace

The [modularization helper](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/01/my-own-require-implementation.html) was **improved**
following the feedback obtained after the first use:

* Errors are **better [documented](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/241)** to help the developer figure
what went wrong and where
* Loaded files now **[appear inside the browser debugger](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/244)**.
The trick consisted in augmenting the file content with a
[SourceURL information](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)

### gpf.require.js

#### Flavor specification

In the previous version, the dependency wheel was added to the source tile to give a visual representation of
the **dependencies**. Also, each source file has been documented with 'tags' qualifying the **feature** or the **host**
the source relates to.

![Sources without any flavor selection](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/
sources%20before%20flavor.png)

Also, in the previous version, a **syntax was initiated** to instruct, in a readable way, which sources should be kept
for a given **flavor**. Combining the features list, hosts specification and dependencies, an
[algorithm - not my proudest one -](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/make/flavor.js) is capable of
generating an array of booleans **filtering the list of sources**.

![Exampe of flavor syntax](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/flavor.png)

As a result, the list of sources is **reduced to meet the flavor specification**.

![Sources with a flavor selection](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/
sources%20after%20flavor.png)

This confirmed that all was ready to setup the [require flavor specification](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/make/flavor/require.json). It contains:
* The **version in which the flavor was introduced**: it is required to build the versions table in the
[readme page](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#versions)
* The **flavor filter string**
* The tests required to **validate the flavor**
* A functional description of the flavor: it will be used to document flavors
* A technical description of the exposed API: the goal is to narrow down the list of namespaces / methods that are
**exposed** by the flavor

#### Testing the flavor

## Lessons learned

Creating this first flavor was quite a challenge. It forced me to rethink the way the code is made.
I also think of further optimization in the final code by removing functions that are not called.

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/15) is not yet clearly defined.
Since I will participate to [UICon'18](https://openui5.org/ui5con/) as a presenter, I will focus on delivering a good
presentation.
