## Release content

### Sporadic Travis issues

From time to time, the Travis continuous integration build was failing with a message indicating that the coverage
information was missing for the browser.

I was first suspecting concurrent execution of hosts to be the cause of the issue until I understood the issue.
For Travis, the browser is spawned. Execution goes until the result is sent to the cache middleware.
At that moment, the command line kills the browser.

However, coverage was saved *after* that step.

Fix is here:

https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/accc6830d5b29af93c734df5b63af082e2cef8ad#diff-1db347236fe2e62038c9d9829be1b967

Coverage was missing for browser
Was due to Chrome testing because the browser was closed *before* uploading the coverage results.

### Improved gpf.require namespace

In browsers, loaded files now appear

Errors are better documented

### gpf.require.js

show dependencies before and After
Explain -http/mock
Explain read
Explain new host specific implementation pattern
Explain mock pattern
Testing

## Lessons learned

Creating this first flavor was quite a challenge. It forced me to rethink the way the code is made.
I also think of further optimization in the final code by removing functions that are not called.

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/15) is not yet clearly defined.
Since I will participate to UICon'18 as a presenter, I will focus on delivering a good presentation.
