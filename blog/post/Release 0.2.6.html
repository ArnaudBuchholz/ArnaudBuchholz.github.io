* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Sporadic Travis issues

From time to time, the **Travis continuous integration build was failing** with a message indicating that the
**coverage information was missing for the browser**. Here is
[a recent example](https://travis-ci.org/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/builds/367614025#L693).

I was first suspecting the **concurrent execution of quality checks** to be the root cause of the issue.
So I disabled it. Still, the problem persisted.

So I took a closer look on how the coverage information was generated while executing tests in the browser.

In the Travis environment, **chrome is spawned as a command line** with options to disable user interface.
When the tests are completed, an AJAX request is triggered to **save the tests results** through the
[cache middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/cache.js).
In the meantime a command line, responsible of spawning the browser, **[waits for the cache to be updated before closing
the process](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.6/test/host/browser.js#L22-L48)**.

Also, the test page is responsible of **saving the coverage information** through another AJAX request that goes to [fs
middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/fs.js).

I realized that the sequence was incorrect: the tests results were sent **before** the coverage information.
The two steps are now executed in the [correct order](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/
accc6830d5b29af93c734df5b63af082e2cef8ad#diff-1db347236fe2e62038c9d9829be1b967).

### Improved gpf.require namespace

The [modularization helper](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/01/my-own-require-implementation.html) was **improved**
following the feedback obtained after the first use:

* Errors are **better [documented](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/241)** to help the developer figure
what went wrong and where
* Loaded files now **[appear inside the browser debugger](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/244)**.
The trick consisted in augmenting the file content with a
[SourceURL information](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)

### gpf.require.js

#### Dependencies

In the previous version, the dependency wheel was added to the source page to visually see the dependencies.

![Sources without any flavor selection](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/sources%20before%20flavor.png)

Based on the existing dependencies, a syntax was created to select which component should be kept (or not).

![Flavor selection](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.6/flavor.png)

As a result, the list of sources is restricted to what fits the flavor specification.

## Lessons learned

Creating this first flavor was quite a challenge. It forced me to rethink the way the code is made.
I also think of further optimization in the final code by removing functions that are not called.

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/15) is not yet clearly defined.
Since I will participate to UICon'18 as a presenter, I will focus on delivering a good presentation.
