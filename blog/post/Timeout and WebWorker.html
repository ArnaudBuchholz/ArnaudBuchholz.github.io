<h2>The context</h2>

<p>Like in most complex JavaScript implementations, I am currently developing
a layer that extensively uses asynchronous executions controlled by
<a href="https://www.promisejs.org/" target="_blank">promises</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, the code deeply relies on the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout"
target="_blank">setTimeout</a> function to defer the actual execution of
the promise completion and let the caller build the chain of callbacks.</p>

<code class="javascript">
function myPromiseBasedFunction() {
    var promise = new Promise();
    /*
        Execute the content of the function and signal the completion with
        promise.resolve()
    */
    return promise;
}

// An example of use:
myPromiseBasedFunction().then(function() {
    // Triggered only when the promise is fulfilled (i.e. resolve was called)
});
</code>

<p>Also, the user interface has been designed to provide the best user
experience. It means that long JavaScript operations are split into chunks and
chained using setTimeout to prevent any UI freeze and get rid of the
annoying long-script running message.</p>

<h2>setTimeout in an inactive tab</h2>

<p>Chrome and FireFox share a particularity that I discovered when using
several tabs (later, I found that Opera was doing the same).
At some point, the application appeared to be 'frozen' when the tab was not
active.</p>

<p>For instance, use the following <a target="_blank"
href="http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/2014-11-21/timeout.html">example
page</a>.<br/>
It was designed to print the current time every 100 milliseconds both in the
page title and in the page content. If the tab is not the active one, you will
notice that it seems to refresh slower (every second).
</p>

<p>You can find good explanations of the reasons why as well as some possible
workarounds:
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6032429/
chrome-timeouts-interval-suspended-in-background-tabs">Chrome: timeouts/interval
suspended in background tabs?</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://pivotallabs.com/
chrome-and-firefox-throttle-settimeout-setinterval-in-inactive-tabs/">Chrome and
Firefox throttle setTimeout/setInterval in inactive tabs</a></li>
</ul></p>

<p>As it seems that the setTimeout function works fine in a Web Worker thread, I
decided to explore this possibility.</p>
