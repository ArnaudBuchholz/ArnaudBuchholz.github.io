## The context

I am currently working on a complex JavaScript application divided into several
layers. On one hand, the communication with the server is centralized in a
dedicated framework that extensively uses asynchronous executions sequenced by
[promises](https://www.promisejs.org/). On the other hand, the application is
contained inside a [SPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
and is designed to provide the best user experience.

### Promises

To make a long story short, a promise represents the result of an asynchronous
operation. It can be:
* pending (by default)
* fulfilled (i.e. succeeded)
* or rejected (i.e. the operation failed)

The most common usage is to wait for the operation completion and chain it with
a callback. This is done by calling the method **then** with one parameter: the
function to call on completion.

For instance:
`// An example of function that uses a promise to signal its completion
function myPromiseBasedFunction() {
    var promise = new Promise();
    /*
        Execute the content of the function and signal the completion using
        promise.resolve(). This can be asynchronous (for instance, using an AJAX
        call) or synchronous. The caller does not need to know.
    */
    return promise;
}

// An example of use:
myPromiseBasedFunction().then(function() {
    // Triggered only when the promise is fulfilled (i.e. resolve was called)
});`

This offers a convenient way to write asynchronous code that can be chained
easily. After creating the promise, the execution starts and even if the
result is available immediately (or synchronously), the promise allows you to
register the callback function **before** it signals the completion.

Hence, to work appropriately, a promise must defer its completion execution to
let the caller build first the chain of callbacks.

Timeout and WebWorker/Promise asynchronous.png)

![Promise synchronous](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
Timeout and WebWorker/Promise synchronous.png)

The only reliable way to implement such a code sequence is to use the
[setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers
.setTimeout) function in order to have the resolve method implementation be
called after the registration of the callback function (i.e. calls of method
**then**).

### Responsive user interface

As any user interface, the design is polished to provide the best user
experience possible.
It means that long JavaScript operations are split into chunks and sequenced
using setTimeout to prevent any interface freeze and get rid of the annoying
long-script running message.

![Long running example in Chrome](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
Timeout and WebWorker/Chrome long running script.png)

This [long running sampler](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
Timeout and WebWorker/long running.html) will allow you to see this dialog.
Enter a number of seconds to wait for (usually 100s) and click go!

## setTimeout in an inactive tab

Chrome and FireFox share a particularity that I discovered when using
several tabs (later, I found that Opera was doing the same but Internet Explorer
and Safari are safe).
At some point, the application appeared to be 'frozen' when the tab was not
active.

For instance, have a look to the following [example page](http://arnaudbuchholz.
github.io/blog/post/Timeout and WebWorker/timeout.html).
It was designed to print the current time every 100 milliseconds both in the
page title and in the page content. If the tab is not active, you will notice
that it seems to refresh slower (nearly every second).
I also added a real-time monitor that displays red dots if the interval between
two calls is greater than 120 ms.

You can find good explanations of the reasons why as well as some possible
workarounds by [crawling the web](https://www.google.ca/search
?q=settimeout+inactive+tab):

* [Chrome: timeouts/interval suspended in background tabs?](http://
stackoverflow.com/questions/6032429/chrome-timeouts-interval-suspended-in-
background-tabs)
* [Chrome and Firefox throttle setTimeout/setInterval in inactive tabs](http://
pivotallabs.com/chrome-and-firefox-throttle-settimeout-setinterval-in-inactive-
tabs/)

As it seems that the setTimeout function works fine in a Web Worker thread, I
decided to explore this possibility.

## Timeout project

I created a new [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
timeout) and started to work on a small library that would solve the issue.

### Skeleton

This script is based on an [immediately-invoked function expression](http:
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression). It has
two advantages:
* A private scope for variables and functions
* When invoked, **[this](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L252)** is translated into
the parameter **[self](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L1)** to provide
the global context object

### Hooking the APIs

First of all, the JavaScript language is really flexible as it relies on
[late binding](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/200115/
what-is-early-and-late-binding). It means that every time you call a function
using a name, the name is first resolved (as any variable) to get the function
object.

for instance:
`/*
    In the following example, the JavaScript engine must:
    - first resolve the variable "gpf"
    - the member "bin" on the previous result
    - the member "toHexa" on the previous result
    This last result is considered as a function
    and called with the parameter 255
*/
var result = gpf.bin.toHexa(255); // result is FF`

In a browser, the main context object (the one that contains everything)
is the [window object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window).
Keep that information in mind, this will be important for the next part.

Hence it is possible to redefine the **setTimeout** function by assigning a new
function to the variable **window.setTimeout**.
I decided to cover the whole timer API, that's why I [redefined](https:
//github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L244) the followings:
* [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers
.setTimeout)
* [clearTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers
.clearTimeout)
* [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers
.setInterval)
* [clearInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers
.clearInterval)

### Creating a Web Worker

To create an [HTML5 Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/
API/Worker)  you need several things:
* An HTML5 browser (most [modern browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
docs/Web/API/Worker#AutoCompatibilityTable) are)
* An URL to load
<div class="note">WARNING: the <a target="_blank"
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">
same-origin policy</a> applies to this URL, you should read the documentation
</div>
* A JavaScript code to create it:
`var worker = new Worker("source.js");`
* A way to communicate with the worker (will be covered in the next part)

Regarding the URL to load,
one challenge that I started with is that I wanted the same script to be
used not only to redefine the APIs in the main context but also to implement
the Web Worker (so that only one file must be distributed).
But it is impossible for a script to know how it has been loaded as you don't
have its 'current' URL.
So I created the method [_getTimeoutURL](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
timeout/blob/8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L209) to
extract this URL:
* It checks if a script tag with the id "timeout" exists
* Or it checks all script tags for the one finishing with "timeout.js"
* Or it returns "timeout.js"

Regarding the worker creation, the same script is used for the main context as
well as the web worker. So I needed a way to distinguish the two situations.
This is where the [window object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/
API/Window") can help. Indeed, a worker thread can't access it: the worker
object itself is the global context of the thread.
That explains why the distinction is made by
[checking the window typeof](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/
blob/8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L235).

### Main thread / WebWorker communication

The communication between the main thread and the web worker is based on
[messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Worker.postMessage"):
they are asynchronous by nature.

Unless you start messing with the **transferList** parameter, you can only
transmit types that are convertible to a JSON representation.

(This is a highly simplified truth. To be exact, HTML5 introduces the notion of
[structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/
API/DOM/The_structured_clone_algorithm) used for serializing complex objects.)

To receive messages, you must register on the "message" event using
[addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/
EventTarget.addEventListener)

* Either on the [created worker object](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/
timeout/blob/8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L243) to listen
to messages sent from the worker to the main thread
* Or the [worker global context](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L249) to listen to the
messages received from the main thread

### Other implementation details

To make a long story short, every time you call setTimeout or setInterval,
a new record is created in the corresponding dictionary ([_timeouts](https://
github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/
timeout.js#L28) or [_intervals](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L39)) to store the
parameters of the call.

Its key is a number that is allocated (incremented) from [_timeoutID](https://
github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/
timeout.js#L20) or [_intervalID](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L31).

Then a message is [sent](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L93) to the worker thread to
execute the timeout function: only the key and the delay are transmitted.

On timeout, the worker [sends](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/timeout/blob/
8bd8e05556d6cc1cf4f8310b24ab23f024a663f7/timeout.js#L157) back a message with
the key to the main thread which retrieves the parameters and executes the
callback.

## Possible improvements

Several aspects of this implementation can be improved:
* **Startup time**: sometimes, the web worker requires several seconds
to run. Because of that, all timeouts may be delayed more than necessary during
this phase. An improvement would consist in switching to the new API only when the new
thread is ready.

* **URL to load**: digging on the net, I found a sample where the web worker
was initialised using a [data: URL](http://dataurl.net/#about).
This clearly reduces the dependency with the source script but, then, we need a
bootstrap to load the code inside the web worker.

## Conclusion

It works and, more important, **without modifying the original code**!
please check the following [example page with fix](http://
arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Timeout and WebWorker/timeout.html?fix)
(and don't forget to switch tab).
