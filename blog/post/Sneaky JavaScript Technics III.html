    A ninja is a master of disguise. How do you apply the JavaScript ninjutsu to hide an object member so that nobody
    can see (and use) it? Here are several ways.

### The context

These days, I started a new [task](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/151) on my
[gpf-js project](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) and it implies manipulating an
[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) structure within [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Because the structure analysis requires to have access to the parent nodes, I augmented the AST items with a link to
their parent. The result is later serialized into
[JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) for tracing purpose but
the generated circular reference broke the conversion.

Actually, I could have used the
[replacer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Parameters)
parameter of the
[JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method
but this circular reference also caused trouble in my own code. Hence I had to find another way.

### Reflection

The JavaScript language offers some [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29)
mechanisms. Indeed, the [for..in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)
syntax is capable of listing all [enumerable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/
Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties) of any object.

(...) I would recommend using [Object.keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Global_Objects/Object/keys) instead. However, the lack of support of old browsers requires that you polyfilled it
with for..in combined with
[hasOwnProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty)
.

This fundamental machinery is widely used:
* [ESlint](http://eslint.org/) offers a rule to detect [unsafe uses](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/guard-for-in)
* JavaScript evolved to make the enumerable state configurable on a property

### Object.defineProperty

The simplest way to add a property to an object is to simply do it:
`var obj = {};
obj.newProperty = "value";`

This newly created property will be enumerable by default.

[ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.2.3.6) introduced
[Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
defineProperty) to create a property with options.
This feature is [implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
defineProperty#Browser_compatibility) by most recent browsers with some limitations when using it on DOM objects.

It can be used in different ways and most of them are beyond the scope of this article.
I will mostly focus on the possibility to create a non-enumerable property:

`var obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, "newProperty", {
  value: "value",
  writable: true,
  enumerable: false,
  configurable: false
});`

By setting [enumerable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
defineProperty#Enumerable_attribute) to false, this property will not be enumerated when using the for..in syntax.
By setting [configurable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
defineProperty#Configurable_attribute) to false, this property can't be deleted and can't be reconfigured to make it
visible again.

The advantages are:
* It is easy to implement
* It is available since IE9

But, regarding the initial purpose, it comes with drawbacks:
* As soon as the name of the property is known, anybody can access it
* [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/
Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptors) is a workaround to enumerate existing properties

You may generate a complex random name to make the task harder for the hacker to figure it out and store it in a
'private' variable for simpler access.

### Symbol

Another simple way to add a property to an object is to use the square bracket syntax:
`var obj = {};
var newPropertyName = "newProperty";
obj[newPropertyName] = "value";`

In that example, the newly created property will be named "newProperty", as per the value of the variable.
The only difference with the dot syntax is the use of a variable to name the property.

But what if the variable is not a string?

For most standard objects (and primitive types), the variable value is converted to string.
Consequently, the following syntax is valid (even if it does not make sense):
`var obj = {};
function any () {}
obj[any] = "value";`

The created property name will be "function any() {}"

(...) This obviously means that you can use names that are not valid
[identifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier).
Hence, it is mandatory to use the bracket syntax to access them.

However, there is one mechanism that behaves differently.
It was introduced with [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0).
Every time you call the
[Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) function, it returns a
unique value. This value type is primitive **but** it does not convert to string.

This feature is [implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/
Symbol#Browser_compatibility) only by most recent browsers and not by IE.

The advantages are:
* It is easy to implement
* There is no way to access the property unless you have the symbol value
