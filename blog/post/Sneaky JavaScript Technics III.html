    A ninja is a master of disguise. How do you apply the JavaScript ninjutsu to hide an object member so that nobody
    can see (and use) it? Here are several ways.

### The context

These days, I started a new [task](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/151) on my
[gpf-js project](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) and it implies manipulating an
[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) structure within [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Because the structure analysis requires to have access to the parent nodes, I augmented the AST items with a link to
their parent. The result is later serialized into
[JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) for tracing purpose but
the generated circular reference broke the conversion.

Actually, I could have used the replacer parameter of the
[JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method
but this circular reference also caused trouble in my own code. Hence I had to find another way.

### Reflection

The JavaScript language offers some [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29)
mechanisms. Indeed, the [for..in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)
syntax is capable of listing all [enumerable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/
Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties) of any object.

(...) I would recommend using [Object.keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Global_Objects/Object/keys) instead. However, the lack of support of old browsers requires that you polyfilled it
with for..in.

This fundamental machinery is widely used internally and by libraries.
That's also why the language offers tools to...

### Object.defineProperty

The [Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
defineProperty) method can be used to define

[Compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
defineProperty#Browser_compatibility)

PROS
    easy to implement
    can be used since IE8

CONS
    if the dev knows the member name, he can extract the info

### Symbol

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Browser_compatibility)

PROS
    easy to implement
    symbol can be 'private'

CONS
    Supported only from
