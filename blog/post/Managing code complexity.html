    Do you brush your teeth? May I ask you why?
    I mean... if you have a cavity, you go to the dentist and he treats it, right?
    But still... fortunately... most people brush their teeth.
    Now let's talk about code: do you care about quality?
    I mean... if you have a bug, you fix it, right?
    But what if I tell you that you can manage the code complexity to reduce the number of bugs?
    As if you were brushing the code !

## Overview

Nearly four years ago, the [GPF-JS](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) project was started.
At that time, I had quite a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve but I was unsure about the how.

First, I wanted to improve my knowledge in JavaScript, to master the subtleties of the language.
I was fascinated by the notion of [JavaScript ninja](https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja) and
I was amazed by both the complexity and simplicity of [John Resig](https://johnresig.com/)'s code.

So I wanted to be able to try out things without breaking everything.

Also, I wanted to discover the JavaScript ecosystem: my experience was limited to browsers and
[wscript](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh875526(v=ws.10).aspx). I was aware of
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and its associated tooling (such as [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)) but I never tried
to use it productively.

Being used to notepad and command line, I wanted to try automation.

At that time, I had written many scripts and even started to build a sort of library.
But it was quite a mess:
* one big file
* manually minified (variables named a/*myIndexVariable*/
* no tests
* no documentation

You got the idea, I wanted it to look 'professional'.

### The first year

I mostly focused in adding features to the library without caring much about the structure or the tests.
Because the library addresses a large audience by being compatible with several hosts, it comes with
[polyfills](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill).

Rather quickly, testing became a necessity. Indeed, as I was striving for the perfect way of doing things, the code
was constantly refactored... which also means constantly broken.

At some point, it was discouraging.
The code base became hard to understand and to maintain.

###

The first big improvement came with TDD.
    Then came the use of Plato and coverage tools: this drastically changed the way I developped the library.

## TDD



### UI Automation

I often get the question regarding TDD and UI automation. Here is one strategy I use.

## Linters

Forbidden instructions

Normalize the code writing
    Formatting
    yoda style / positive conditions
    ...

## Plato

Real time analysis


## Documentation

## Source management

## Automation

Grunt significantly reduced the time spent on the 'administrative' tasks.
Every code change is automatically linted, tested with NodeJS and Plato is triggered to estimate the change in code complexity
