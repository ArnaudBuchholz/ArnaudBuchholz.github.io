## Overview

When I started the GPF-JS project, I had several goals in mind. First, I wanted to improve my knowledge in JavaScript.
At that time, I had written many scripts and even started to build a sort of library but I wanted to better understand
how a big JavaScript project could be designed following the best practices.

The first year, I mostly focused in adding features to the library without caring much about the structure and the tests.
From the beginning, I wanted the library to address a large audience by making it compatible with several hosts.
Naturally, I came up with polyfills concepts.

Rather quickly, testing became a necessity. Indeed, as I was looking for the perfect way of doing things, I was constantly
refactoring the code... which also means I broke it many times.

I also quickly understood that the code became hard to maintain: too many concepts, ...

The first big improvement came with TDD.
    Then came the use of Plato and coverage tools: this drastically changed the way I developped the library.

## TDD

### TDD with UI Automation



## Linters

Forbidden instructions

Normalize the code writing
    Formatting
    yoda style / positive conditions
    ...

## Plato

## Documentation

## Source management

## Automation

Grunt significantly reduced the time spent on the 'administrative' tasks.
Every code change is automatically linted, tested with NodeJS and Plato is triggered to estimate the change in code complexity
