    A journey of thousand miles starts with a single step. It looks like the setup phase is completed.
    Let's try the first program.

<code class="markdown">
It finally appeared that the USB cable was responsible of my troubles.
I learned that they are two kind of cables:
* Those that only provide power supply
* Those that provide the full wiring, allowing serial bus communication

Guess what...

So, after getting the proper cable, I finally heard the magic new USB device sound in Windows when connecting the Wemos.

Excited, I opened Arduino and checked if the port was available... and yes it is !

To validate the whole setup, I got a sample program from this
[page](http://www.cnx-software.com/2016/03/22/getting-started-with-wemos-d1-mini-esp8266-board-dht-relay-shields/) and
compiled it.

Then, I clicked the upload program, unplugged the device from the workstation and plugged it on the battery.

Et voila !
