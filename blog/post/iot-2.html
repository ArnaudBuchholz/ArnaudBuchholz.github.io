It finally appeared that the USB cable was responsible of my troubles.
I learned that they are two kind of cables:
* Those that only provide power supply
* Those that provide the full wiring, allowing serial bus communication

Guess what...

So, after getting the proper cable, I finally heard the magic new USB device sound in Windows when connecting the Wemos.

Excited, I opened Arduino and checked if the port was available... and yes it is !
