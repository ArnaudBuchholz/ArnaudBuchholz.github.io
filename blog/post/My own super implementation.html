    Release 0.1.6 of GPF-JS delivers a basic class definition mechanism.
    Working on the release 0.1.7, the focus is to improve this implementation by providing mechanism that mimic
    the ES6 class definition. In particular, the super keyword is replaced with a $super member that provides
    the same level of functionalities. Here is how.

<code class="markdown">
## Introduction

The [super](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super) keyword was introduced
with ECMAScript 2015. Its goal is to simplify the access to parent methods of an object.
It can be used within a class definition or directly in object literals. We will focus on class definition.

### Class examples

To demonstrate the usage, let define a simple class A.
`class A {

    constructor (value = "a") {
        this._a = true;
        this._value = value;
    }

    getValue () {
        return this._value;
    }

}`

In that example, the class A offers a constructor with an optional parameter (defaulted to "a").
Upon execution, it sets the member _a to true (this will be used later to validate the constructor call).
Also, the member _value receives the value of the parameter.
Finally, the method getValue exposes _value.

Then, let subclass it with class B.
`class B extends A {

    constructor () {
        super("b");
        this._b = true;
    }

    getValue () {
        return super.getValue().toUpperCase();
    }
}`

When instances of B are built, the constructor of A is explicitly called with the parameter "b".
Also, the behavior of the method getValue is modified to uppercase the result of parent implementation.

None of these features are new to JavaScript. Indeed, the exact same definition can be achieved without any of the
ECMAScript 2015 keywords.

For instance:

`function A (value) {
    this._a = true;
    this._value = value || "a";
}

Object.assign(A.prototype, {
    getValue: function () {
        return this._value;
    }
});

function B () {
    A.call(this, "b");
    this._b = true;
}

B.prototype = Object.create(A.prototype);
Object.assign(B.prototype, {
    getValue: function () {
        return A.prototype.getValue.call(this).toUpperCase();
    }
});`

(...) There are several ways to implement inheritance in JavaScript.
In this example, the pattern used in GPF-JS is demonstrated.

### Differences

Whether you use one syntax or the other, both versions of A and B will look (and behave) the same:
* A and B are functions
* A.prototype has a method named getValue
* b instances only have own properties _a, _b and _value
* b instanceof A works

[Class version (Chrome & Firefox only)](https://jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/um9511we/1/)

[Function version](https://jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/kj457uvu/2/)

### So, why would you use the super keyword?

As you may see in the examples, accessing the parent methods without super is possible but requires the knowledge of the
parent class being extended. Furthermore the syntax is not easy to remember... Well, after using it a thousand times,
you end knowing it by heart.

* In the constructor, `super("b")` is replaced with `A.call(this, "b")`

* In a method, `super.getValue()` is replaced with `A.prototype.getValue.call(this)`

As a consequence, any update in the class hierarchy would lead to a mass search & replace in the code.

Beside this, one could say that this keyword is a typical example of
[syntaxic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) as it does not bring new feature.

(...) if you forget about object literals...

### Exploring the feature

Even if the documentation on super is extensive, some questions remains about the way it reacts to
[edge cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case).

#### Redefining parent method

What happens if the parent prototype is modified? Does it call the modified method or does it call the method that was
existing when the child method is defined.

The link is dynamic.

[Example (Chrome & Firefox only)](https://jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/Layhbjye/)

(...) This is consistent with the function implementation: A.prototype.getValue re-evaluates the member every time it
is called.

#### Getting function object

Is it possible to access the parent method without invoking it? Does it return a function object?

It returns the parent function object.

[Example (Chrome & Firefox only)](https://jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/34n4ae99/4/)

(...) It is important to notice that if not invoked immediately (look at getSuperGetValue in the example), the value of
[this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) is undefined.

#### Checking parent method existence

Finally, how does the super keyword validate the method that is accessed: what happens if you try to
reference a non existing member: does it fail when generating the class or upon method execution?

Accessing a non existing member returns
[undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined).

[Example (Chrome & Firefox only)](https://jsfiddle.net/54L2eovo/1/)

(...) This is also consistent with the function implementation: it makes sense that the error is thrown at evaluation
time.

## A super idea

One of the goal of [GPF-JS](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) is to provide the same feature set whatever the
host running the script. Because some of them are old (Rhino and WScript), it is not only impossible to use recent
features but also it prevents the use of
[transpilers](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them).

[gpf.define](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/doc/tutorials/DEFINE.md#class) is a class definition
helper exposed by the library since [version 0.1.6](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/02/release-016.html).
But it would not be complete without a mechanism that mimics the super keyword in order to reduce the complexity of
calling parent methods.

super being a reserved keyword, it could not be used. But as the library reserves $ properties for specific usage, the
idea of defining $super naturally came up.

In order to make the $super keyword a global one (like super), the library had to tweak the global context object which
generated lots of issues (leaks detected in mocha, validation errors in linters, the variable could already be defined
by the developer...). So, $super had to be attached to the context of the class instance.

this.$super was defined and had to support two different syntaxes:

* Calling `this.$super` must be equivalent to `super`

* Calling `this.$super.methodName` must be equivalent to `super.methodName`

### Introducing class definition

The library internally uses an object to retain the initial definition dictionary, parse it and build the class handler.
This [class definition](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/define/class/class.js) object is not
yet exposed but will be in the future through a read-only interface.

This object is a key component of this implementation as it
[keeps track](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/define/class/check.js) of the class properties
such as the extended base class. This will be leveraged to access parent methods.

(...) [Object.getPrototypeOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
getPrototypeOf) could be used to escalate the prototype chain and retrieve the base class and methods.
However, this method is
[poorly polyfilled](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/compatibility/object.js#L52-L60) on old
hosts and it does not work as expected with standard objects.

### Wrapping methods

Before being able to cope with this.$super calls inside a method, the library has to make sure that the $super member
exists before executing the method.

A long time ago, when studying JavaScript inheritance, I found this very interesting
[article](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/) from [John Resig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeresig)
(the creator of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)).

It took me ages to fully understand its Class.extend helper but it demonstrates a brilliant JavaScript ninja technique:
by testing the method with a regular expression, it is capable of finding out if a class method uses the _super keyword.
If so, the method is wrapped inside a container function that defines the _super member for the lifetime of the call.

`// Check if we’re overwriting an existing function
prototype[name] = typeof prop[name] == "function" &&
typeof _super[name] == "function" && fnTest.test(prop[name]) ?
    (function(name, fn){
        return function() {
            var tmp = this._super;

            // Add a new ._super() method that is the same method
            // but on the super-class
            this._super = _super[name];

            // The method only need to be bound temporarily, so we
            // remove it when we’re done executing
            var ret = fn.apply(this, arguments);
            this._super = tmp;

            return ret;
        };
    })(name, prop[name])
    : prop[name];`

Typically, GPF-JS uses the same strategy to [detect](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
90b7c70c900a226fb652e7efd10a8573be5e270c/src/define/class/super.js#L207-L210) the use of $super and
[wrap](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/90b7c70c900a226fb652e7efd10a8573be5e270c/src/define/class/
super.js#L191-L196) the method in a new one that defines the value of this.$super.

(...) The use of _gpfFunctionDescribe and _gpfFunctionBuild guarantees that the signature of the final method will be
the same as the initial one. Indeed, GPF-JS will soon enable interfaces validation and signatures of methods have to
match.

### Invoking a function

When calling this.$super(), the method $super would obviously receive the proper context.

However, things are more complicated when calling this.$super.methodName().

If you understand how
[JavaScript function invocation](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/javascript-the-good/9780596517748/
ch04s03.html) works, you know that inside methodName,
[this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) would be equal to this.$super.

And that is a function object.

So how could I make sure that the proper context would be transmitted to methodName?

Function binding could be use to force the value of but then we would loose the possibility to invoke it with any
context.

### Function binding

Before [Function.prototype.bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/
Function/bind) was introduced, people used to create a closure to force the value of this inside a function.

`Function.prototype.bind = function(oThis) {
    var fToBind = this;
    return function () {
        return fToBind.apply(oThis, arguments);
    }
};`

This concept was also made popular with [jQuery.proxy](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/).

The drawback is that, once a function is bound, it is no more possible to change the context it is executed with.

[Demonstration](https://jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/duxnd03m/)
`function getValue() {
  return this.value;
}

// Passing the context
log(getValue.call({
	value: "Hello World"
})); // output "Hello World"

// Binding
var boundGetValue = getValue.bind({
	value: "Bound"
});
log(boundGetValue());  // output "Bound"

// Trying to pass a different context
log(boundGetValue.call({
	value: "Hello World"
})); // output "Bound"

// Trying to bind again
var reboundGetValue = boundGetValue.bind({
	value: "Hello World"
});
log(reboundGetValue());  // output "Bound"`

Back to the $super.methodName example, I needed a way to bind the method so that it could be called with a different
context: a sort of weak bind.

### Dynamic mapping of super method

When the class is being defined, a dictionary mapping method names to their implementation is passed to
[gpf.define](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/doc/tutorials/DEFINE.md#class).
This definition dictionary is enumerated so that when the $super use is detected in a method, the name of the parent
method is known.

This name (as well as members of $super) is remembered in a [closure](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
90b7c70c900a226fb652e7efd10a8573be5e270c/src/define/class/super.js#L195) and passed to the function
[_get$Super](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholzgpf-js/blob/90b7c70c900a226fb652e7efd10a8573be5e270c/src/define/class/
super.js#L147) before calling the method.

(...) Actually, the keyword super can't be used alone outside of the constructor function. this.$super overcomes this
limitation.

### Building a new $super method object

The class definition method _get$Super [creates a new function](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
90b7c70c900a226fb652e7efd10a8573be5e270c/src/define/class/super.js#L195) instead of reusing the parent one. The reason
is quite simple. A JavaScript function being an object, it is allowed to add methods to it.
However, the libray is not supposed to alter objects defined by the developer (maybe he already added some members to
its function).

### Dynamic members of super

Beside the fact that the methodName should exist in the inherited prototype, we still need to overcome two problems:

1) if $super is equal to the inherited method, I am not allowed to modify it
2) if invoked with .call or .apply, I want the this to be modifiable
3) For performance reasons, I don't want to define *all* possible members of $super by copying the inherited methods

#### Weak binding

$super being known when the methods are defined, I can check that this === $super and substitute when needed

#### Detecting $super members

Guess what, a regular expression is being used to list members that are used.
