## The idea

I have **millions of ideas**: some are stupid *(and it's ok)* and some *may* be interesting.
Sadly, for most of them, **time and resources are missing** to shape and mature them properly.
Somehow, we must **choose our battles**.

On rare occasions, **that crazy idea which doesn't make sense** comes up... and it would be really **cool to try** it.

This is more or less **how the [GPF-JS library](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) project started** several
years ago.
Building a library supporting most of the hosts existing at that time and that would allow experimenting some cool
concepts with JavaScript was appealing (classes, interfaces, streams, documentation generation, TDD, code
coverage, backward compatibility testing...).

So far, it is a success since **a lot was learned from that experience**:
* [My own require implementation](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2018/01/my-own-require-implementation.html)
* [5 ways to make an http request](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2017/06/5-ways-to-make-http-request.html)
* [My own super implementation](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2017/02/my-own-super-implementation.html)
* [My own jsdoc plugin](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2016/12/my-own-jsdoc-plugin.html)
* [My own templates implementation](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2016/08/my-own-templates-implementation.html)
* [Date override](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2016/02/date-override.html)
* [My own BDD implementation](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2015/10/my-own-bdd-implementation.html)
* And all the [release notes](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/releases) of the library

These days, I am working on a side project that requires **a backend to hold the data**. Obviously, the
implementation started with NodeJS as it is good opportunity to push my **ES6 knowledge** a little bit further.

The project reached the point where **some features of the GPF-JS library could be leveraged**.

This means that the library needs to **[support ES6 code](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/303)**.

However, since it is designed to be compatible with so many hosts *(and some of them are deprecated)*, it somehow
sets the language support to quite a **low standard (some may say 'old' JavaScript)**.

(...) [Transpiling](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them) could have been
an option but some hosts are not even supporting the resulting ES5 code.

Among the [exposed api](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html), there is an entry point to **define
classes: [gpf.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.define__anchor)**.
Inheritance is specified by setting the *$extend* property in the
[entity definition](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-DEFINE.html).

The library even offers a [$super](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2017/02/my-own-super-implementation.html) helper to
**facilitate calling the base class method** whenever it makes sense.

So far so good.

But **what would happen if** one applies this API with an ES6 class?

`const gpf = require("gpf-js");

class A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A";
  }
}

const B = gpf.define({
  $class: "B",
  $extend: A,
  constructor: function () {
    this.$super();
    this._b = "B";
  }
})

const b = new B();`

The result is:

`TypeError: Class constructor A cannot be invoked without 'new'`

(...) Before going any further, it is important to check that your browser supports the ES6 syntax. If you are using
Internet Explorer, please switch to a different one.

Two **colliding ways of creating classes** producing sparks...
Let see what can be **learned** from that.

## Building JavaScript classes

### The 'old' way

There are many ways to build a class and leverage
**[prototype inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance)** in
JavaScript. Here is **the pattern used in GPF-JS**.

First, a class is represented by its **constructor function**.

Every [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions) object exposes a
**prototype property**, an object which members are **inherited by all instances** created
with this function.

Therefore, the class **members are added to the function prototype**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / The 'old' way
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
function OldA () {
  this._a = "A";
}

OldA.prototype.a = function () {
  return this._a;
};

var a = new OldA();
assert(() => a instanceof OldA);
assert(() => a.a() === "A");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/8bhgLqt6/7/embed/js,result/"></script>

To create a subclass, **a new constructor function is needed**.

The base constructor is called by **[applying](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Global_Objects/Function/apply) the base function** on the newly created instance.

(...) As mentioned previously, The GPF-JS library facilitates calling the base class constructor using
[this.$super()]([$super](https://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2017/02/my-own-super-implementation.html).

On the other hand, the new function prototype is initialized with an **object that inherits from the base class
prototype** using
[Object.create](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create).

Consequently, all members of the base class will be inherited by the subclass. Also, instances will be recognized
by the [instanceof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof) operator.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / The 'old' way
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
function OldA () {
  this._a = "A";
}

OldA.prototype.a = function () {
  return this._a;
};

var a = new OldA();
assert(() => a instanceof OldA);
assert(() => a.a() === "A");

function OldB () {
  OldA.apply(this, arguments);
  this._b = "B";
}

OldB.prototype = Object.create(OldA.prototype);

OldB.prototype.b = function () {
  return this._b;
};

var b = new OldB();
assert(() => b instanceof OldA);
assert(() => b.a() === "A");
assert(() => b instanceof OldB);
assert(() => b.b() === "B");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/8bhgLqt6/embed/js,result/"></script>

### The ES6 way

The [class keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/class) was introduced
and the syntax is **self-explanatory**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / The ES6 way
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
class Es6A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A";
  }

  a () {
    return this._a;
  }
}

class Es6B extends Es6A {
  constructor () {
    super();
    this._b = "B";
  }

  b () {
    return this._b;
  }
}

var b = new Es6B();
assert(() => b instanceof Es6A);
assert(() => b.a() === "A");
assert(() => b instanceof Es6B);
assert(() => b.b() === "B");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/b81aesr5/embed/js,result"></script>

It is interesting to observe that **Es6A and Es6B are also functions**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / The ES6 way (2)
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
class Es6A {
  constructor (value) {
    this._a = value;
  }

  a () {
    return this._a;
  }
}

assert(() => typeof Es6A === "function");
assert(() => Es6A.length === 1);
assert(() => typeof Es6A.apply === "function");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/dtrayepf/embed/js,result"></script>

### Subclassing an 'old' class in an ES6 class

Good news, the following code **works smoothly**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Subclassing an 'old' class in an ES6 class
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
function OldA () {
  this._a = "A";
}

OldA.prototype.a = function () {
  return this._a;
};

class ExtendOldWithEs6B extends OldA {
    constructor () {
      super();
      this._b = "B";
    }

    b () {
      return this._b;
    }
}

var b = new ExtendOldWithEs6B();
assert(() => b instanceof OldA);
assert(() => b.a() === "A");
assert(() => b instanceof ExtendOldWithEs6B);
assert(() => b.b() === "B");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/hqb490wL/embed/js,result"></script>

### Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class

The code presented in the introduction almost **looks like the following example**.
It obviously leads to the **same error**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
class Es6A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A";
  }

  a () {
    return this._a;
  }
}

function ExtendEs6WithOldB () {
  Es6A.apply(this, arguments);
  this._b = "B";
}

ExtendEs6WithOldB.prototype = Object.create(Es6A.prototype);

ExtendEs6WithOldB.prototype.b = function () {
  return this._b;
};

var b = new ExtendEs6WithOldB();
assert(() => b instanceof Es6A);
assert(() => b.a() === "A");
assert(() => b instanceof ExtendEs6WithOldB);
assert(() => b.b() === "B");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/1kbozc3w/embed/js,result"></script>

## Class constructor cannot be invoked without 'new'

If you think about the old way of creating classes, this error fully makes sense.
Indeed, in the old way, there is **no syntax difference between a normal function and a class constructor**.
As a result, both could be either invoked or called with the
[new  keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new).

However, all JavaScript functions are not **constructors**. Indeed, most **native methods** are secured:

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / all functions are not constructors
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
const substring = String.prototype.substring;
assert(() => typeof substring === "function");
const instance = new substring();
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/a96gfdm1/embed/js,result"></script>

When it comes to the new syntax, **the intention of the developer** is to build a function that will be used to create
instances. Therefore, **the language doesn't expect this function to be invoked for a simple function call**.

### Reproduce the behavior in the 'old' way

It is possible to reproduce this behavior with the 'old' syntax.
The *new* operator will instantiate an object and pass it during the **function invocation**.
This means that **testing [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) with
[instanceof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof) will do the
trick**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Reproduce the behavior in the 'old' way
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
function OldA () {
  if (!(this instanceof OldA)) {
    throw new TypeError("Class constructor cannot be invoked without 'new'");
  }
  this._a = "A";
}

OldA.prototype.a = function () {
  return this._a;
};

var a = new OldA();
assert(() => a instanceof OldA);
assert(() => a.a() === "A");
assert(() => OldA());

function OldB () {
  OldA.apply(this, arguments);
  this._b = "B";
}

OldB.prototype = Object.create(OldA.prototype);

OldB.prototype.b = function () {
  return this._b;
};

var b = new OldB();cd
assert(() => b instanceof OldA);
assert(() => b.a() === "A");
assert(() => b instanceof OldB);
assert(() => b.b() === "B");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/tauek0pL/embed/js,result/"></script>

Note that, in this implementation pattern, the base constructor call works because **any instance of OldB is also an
instance of OldA**.

(...) This behavior is already
[implemented](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.8/src/define/class/constructor.js#L59) in GPF-JS.

(...) A simpler alternative consists in using
[new.target](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target) but it was defined
in ECMAScript 2015.

(...) Again, there were many ways to create classes before the introduction of the class keyword. Some may disagree with
the use of instanceof. To be fair and complete, I invite you to check the article [JavaScript Factory Functions vs
Constructor Functions vs Classes](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor
-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e) from Eric Elliott who exposes a different point of view.

### Notable differences between the two ways of creating class

As explained previously in the 'Old' way of creating classes, the base constructor is called by applying the base
function on *this*. However, there is **no limitation on when the base constructor can be applied**. Furthermore, it is
**not even required to call it**.

As a matter of fact, you can start leveraging the newly created instance even **before it was properly built**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Notable differences (Old way)
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
function OldA () {
  this._a = "A";
}

OldA.prototype.a = function () {
  return this._a;
};

var a = new OldA();
assert(() => a instanceof OldA);
assert(() => a.a() === "A");

function OldB () {
  this._b = "B"; // Use this before it was properly built
  OldA.apply(this, arguments);
}

OldB.prototype = Object.create(OldA.prototype);

OldB.prototype.b = function () {
  return this._b;
};

var b = new OldB();
assert(() => b instanceof OldA);
assert(() => b.a() === "A");
assert(() => b instanceof OldB);
assert(() => b.b() === "B");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/t8ef1p5y/embed/js,result/"></script>

It has been enforced with ES6 as **it is not possible to use *this* before calling the
[super](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super) constructor**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Notable differences (ES6 way)
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
class Es6A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A";
  }

  a () {
    return this._a;
  }
}

class Es6B extends Es6A {
  constructor () {
    this._b = "B";  // Use this before it was properly built
    super();
  }

  b () {
    return this._b;
  }
}

var b = new Es6B();
assert(() => b instanceof Es6A);
assert(() => b.a() === "A");
assert(() => b instanceof Es6B);
assert(() => b.b() === "B");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/wxa30178/embed/js,result"></script>

The result shows:
`Uncaught ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor`

### Detecting an ES6 class constructor

If the library has to deal with ES6 classes, it needs **a safe way to detect such constructors**.

Actually, this can easily be done by **converting the function to string and by checking if it starts with the *class*
keyword**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Detecting an ES6 class constructor
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js
function OldA () {
  this._a = "A";
}

OldA.prototype.a = function () {
  return this._a;
};

class Es6A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A";
  }

  a () {
    return this._a;
  }
}

function isES6Constructor (constructor) {
  return constructor.toString().startsWith("class");
}

assert(() => !isES6Constructor(OldA));
assert(() => isES6Constructor(Es6A));
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/prg4L5mk/embed/js,result"></script>

## Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class

The 'old' pattern does not work because the **ES6 constructor can't be applied like a normal function**.
What can be done to create an 'old' class that would subclass an ES6 one?

### ConstructorOfB

First, let set the right **context and expectations**:
* *gpf.define* is used with a dictionary having the *$extend* property set to an ES6 class constructor
* a *constructor* property points to a JavaScript function
* *this.$super* is called to invoke the base constructor
* to respect the ES6 constraints, *this.$super* must be called before any use of this or the construction should fail

**To validate the implementation**, we will place it within the following statements:

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js

class A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A"
  }
}

class B extends A {
  constructor (param) {
    super()
    this._b = "B"
    this._param = param
  }
}

// This is the constructor that would be provided in the gpf.define dictionary
function constructorOfC (param2) {
  this.$super("test")
  this._c = "C"
  this._param2 = param2
}

// We need a way to create a class C that inherits from B calling constructorOfC
function C () { }

// Validation
var c = new C("test2");
assert(() => c instanceof A);
assert(() => c._a === "A");
assert(() => c instanceof B);
assert(() => c._b === "B");
assert(() => c._param === "test");
assert(() => c instanceof C);
assert(() => c._c === "C");
assert(() => c._param2 === "test2");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/zg70m9of/embed/js,result"></script>

### Attempt number 1: The copycat

The very first attempt exploits a trick that I mastered while developing the library.

It is possible to **create JavaScript functions dynamically** using the
[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) constructor.

This is **detected as [an issue](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-func) by most linters** because
it looks like an [eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval).
However, it is more secure since the created function has a **restricted access to the current scope**.

As explained in MDN: *Functions created with the Function constructor do not create closures to their creation contexts;
they always are created in the global scope. When running them, they will only be able to access their own local
variables and global ones, not the ones from the scope in which the Function constructor was created.
This is different from using eval with code for a function expression.*

This reduces the risk of conflicts with existing names.
But, in consequence, you need to **pass the values you want to access in the created function**.

To summarize, the first attempt consists in creating a **class factory** function where:
* the constructor is a copy of *constructorOfC* with *this.$super* being replaced with *super*

* the base class will be passed as a parameter

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js

class A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A"
  }
}

class B extends A {
  constructor (param) {
    super()
    this._b = "B"
    this._param = param
  }
}

// This is the constructor that would be provided in the gpf.define dictionary
function constructorOfC (param2) {
  this.$super("test")
  this._c = "C"
  this._param2 = param2
}

// We need a way to create a class C that inherits from B calling constructorOfC
var C = new Function("B", `

  return class C extends B {
    constructor ${
      /\((?:.|\n)*}$/.exec(constructorOfC)
        .toString()
        .replace("this.$super", "super")
    }
  }

`)(B);

// Validation
var c = new C("test2");
assert(() => c instanceof A);
assert(() => c._a === "A");
assert(() => c instanceof B);
assert(() => c._b === "B");
assert(() => c._param === "test");
assert(() => c instanceof C);
assert(() => c._c === "C");
assert(() => c._param2 === "test2");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/zg70m9of/13/embed/js,result"></script>

(...) In the previous code, an ES6 template literal has been used to build the constructor string. This syntax would not
be allowed in the library because it would not compile on older hosts.

**It works !**

But...

As explained previously, the class constructor that is created from the *constructorOfC* function code **does not keep
the context of its source**. If *constructorOfC* is a **closure accessing names from its local scope**,
everything is lost.

This would probably work for some situations but, to keep its context, **we must execute *constructorOfC* as-is**.

### Attempt number 2: Applying constructorOfC on this

Considering we must keep and call *constructorOfC* as-is, **what happens if we can call it directly ?**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js

class A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A"
  }
}

class B extends A {
  constructor (param) {
    super()
    this._b = "B"
    this._param = param
  }
}

// This is the constructor that would be provided in the gpf.define dictionary
function constructorOfC (param2) {
  this.$super("test")
  this._c = "C"
  this._param2 = param2
}

// We need a way to create a class C that inherits from B calling constructorOfC
class C extends B {
  $super () {
    super.construtor();
  }
  constructor (param2) {
    constructorOfC.apply(this, arguments);
  }
}

// Validation
var c = new C("test2");
assert(() => c instanceof A);
assert(() => c._a === "A");
assert(() => c instanceof B);
assert(() => c._b === "B");
assert(() => c._param === "test");
assert(() => c instanceof C);
assert(() => c._c === "C");
assert(() => c._param2 === "test2");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/zg70m9of/16/embed/js,result"></script>

But *this* is used **before** *super* is called. As a consequence, it fails with:
`Uncaught ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor`

## Attempt number 3: Building this

Let consider the assumption that the **base class supports instantiation with no parameters**.

Because we must call *super* before using *this*, we start the constructor with a call to *super()* to
initialize *this*.
Then we apply *constructorOfC* on *this* and we make sure that** *this.$super* would call the constructor** again
(through *super.constructor*).

What will happen?

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js

class A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A"
  }
}

class B extends A {
  constructor (param) {
    super()
    this._b = "B"
    this._param = param
  }
}

// This is the constructor that would be provided in the gpf.define dictionary
function constructorOfC (param2) {
  this.$super("test")
  this._c = "C"
  this._param2 = param2
}

// We need a way to create a class C that inherits from B calling constructorOfC
class C extends B {
  $super () {
    super.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
  }
  constructor (param2) {
    super();
    constructorOfC.apply(this, arguments);
  }
}

// Validation
var c = new C("test2");
assert(() => c instanceof A);
assert(() => c._a === "A");
assert(() => c instanceof B);
assert(() => c._b === "B");
assert(() => c._param === "test");
assert(() => c instanceof C);
assert(() => c._c === "C");
assert(() => c._param2 === "test2");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/zg70m9of/19/embed/js,result"></script>

It throws the error:
`Uncaught TypeError: Class constructor B cannot be invoked without 'new'`

## Attempt number 4: An unusual way to invoke a constructor

So far, trying to **apply the base constructor on the newly created instance** appears to be a dead end.
Indeed, the only way to call the base constructor is to use the *new* keyword.

But doing so would create a new instance of the base class: it won't **be chained to the right prototype**.
This prevents subclassing.

(...) One ugly hack would consist in switching the base constructor function's prototype value before calling *new* and
restore it after.

Is it really the only way?

After doing some [research on the web](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=JavaScript+How+to+call+an+ES6+constructor), this particular
[stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30689817/es6-call-class-constructor-without-new-keyword) gave
the answer.

A comment from 2015 says:

"*For subclassing Foo (...) with class Bar extends Foo ..., you should use return **Reflect.construct(_Foo, args,
new.target)** instead (...). Subclassing in ES5 style (with Foo.call(this, ...)) is **not possible**.*"

I got my first *Aha* moment ! And I immediately checked the [Reflect object
documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect).

In particular, the [Reflect.construct
method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/construct)
acts like the new operator, but as a function. **It is equivalent to calling new target(...args)**.
It also gives the added option to **specify a different prototype**.

This helper not only **solves the problem of calling the base class constructor**, but it also allocates
a **new object with the right prototype chain**.

However, the method **returns a new instance: it can't be applied on an existing one**.

Considering the construction will happen while executing the function *constuctorOfC*, we need to provide an initial
value for *this* that supports the *$super* method. Then we need to 'substitute' it **after** the final instance was
allocated.

Then came second *Aha* moment !

Why not creating a **wrapper** that would expose the **same interface than a new instance of C** but would
redirect all properties access to the instance created with *Reflect.construct* using
[Object.defineProperties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/
defineProperties) ?

An additional method of the wrapper, named *$super*, would call **Reflect.construct** to create the final instance.

As the **final instance is not created unless this.$super has been called**, any call forward would fail. It
validates that *super* must be called first.

One last problem remains.

The whole purpose is to create a subclass which constructor will be invoked with *new*
and that **must return an instance of the proper class**. By default, when *new* is invoked with a constructor, the
JavaScript engine is responsible of allocating the new instance and it invokes the constructor with it.
The result of the new expression is this initially allocated instance.

In our case, *Reflect.construct* will create another instance that **must be the result of the new expression**.

Luckily, JavaScript supports replacing the allocated object by another one **using the
[return statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return)
at the end of the constructor code**.

This behavior is described in the
[new operator documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new): *The
object (not null, false, 3.1415 or other primitive types) returned by the constructor function becomes the result of the
whole new expression.*


(...) This is how [singletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) are implemented in GPF-JS.

To summarize:
* Reflect.construct builds an instance of C initialized with constructor of B
* The initial value of *this* is ignored, a wrapper is used to invoke *constructorOfC*

* The final instance is returned at the end of the class constructor

assert(() => c._param2 === "test2");

**It works !**

But...

The problem is that **all the accessed properties must be redirected from the wrapper to the instance**.
In this example, it is easy because the content of the object and its constructors is **already known**.

In the library, it won't be true.

## Attempt number 5: Shadowing the object

Digging further in the same [stackoverflow
thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30689817/es6-call-class-constructor-without-new-keyword), some proposed
the use of **proxies** but for a different purpose.

Checking the documentation again, I realized that the **[Proxy
object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)** can be
used to define **custom behavior for fundamental operations**... like property lookup.

This last piece of the information leaded to the **final solution below**.

<!-- How I learned from a crazy idea / Subclassing an ES6 class in an 'old' class
// https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/jsfiddle-assert.js

class A {
  constructor () {
    this._a = "A"
  }
}

class B extends A {
  constructor (param) {
    super()
    this._b = "B"
    this._param = param
  }
}

// This is the constructor that would be provided in the gpf.define dictionary
function constructorOfC (param2) {
  this.$super("test")
  this._c = "C"
  this._param2 = param2
}

// We need a way to create a class C that inherits from B calling constructorOfC
function C () {
  var
    instance,
    $super = function () {
      instance = Reflect.construct(B, arguments, C);
    },
    proxy = new Proxy({}, {
      get: function (obj, property) {
        if (property === '$super') {
          return $super;
        }
        return instance[property];
      },
      set: function (obj, property, value) {
        instance[property] = value;
      }
    });
  constructorOfC.apply(proxy, arguments);
  return instance;
}
C.prototype = Object.create(B.prototype);

// Validation
var c = new C("test2");
assert(() => c instanceof A);
assert(() => c._a === "A");
assert(() => c instanceof B);
assert(() => c._b === "B");
assert(() => c._param === "test");
assert(() => c instanceof C);
assert(() => c._c === "C");
assert(() => c._param2 === "test2");
-->
<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/ArnaudBuchholz/zg70m9of/32/embed/js,result"></script>

**It works !**

I didn't find any drawback yet *(but it is still under study)*.

## Conclusion

As useless as it may sound, **the library will now support ES6 classes**. But besides this feature, this small
experience (or should I say challenge) **introduced me to new JavaScript objects** which, at first sight,
had no interest but that are really helpful to solve the problems I faced.

Regarding the support of the
[Reflect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect)
[Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
objects, they will be used only when an ES6 class is detected.
