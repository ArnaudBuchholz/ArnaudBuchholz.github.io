### The context

Maybe you already know it, but a
[input type=hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/
Input) field does not generate any [change event](https://developer.mozilla.org/
en-US/docs/Web/Events/change).

For some reasons, I had to detect when the value of one specific hidden field
was changed in order to trigger the execution of a custom function.
I had no way to change the code that was setting the value of the field so I had
to find a solution that was field-centric.

(...) A quick note before going any further: I don't pretend that any of the
solutions below is the right thing to do but, as a matter of fact, I learned a
lot by trying and doing mistakes.
The key here is that I tried several ways to solve my problem and I finally kept
the one that suited my needs at that moment (knowing that a more stable solution
would come).

### First attempt: active monitoring

My first thought was to monitor the field using a timer in order to check if the
field changed.

`(function () {/*gpf:apply-jshint*/
    "use strict";

    var
        _fieldHandle = document.getElementById("hiddenFieldID"),
        lastValue = _fieldHandle.value;

    function actionToBeTriggered(/*value*/) {
        // What needs to be done when the value changed
    }

    function didTheHiddenFieldChanged() {
        if (_fieldHandle.value !== lastValue) {
            lastValue = _fieldHandle.value;
            actionToBeTriggered(lastValue);
        }
    }

    window.setTimer(didTheHiddenFieldChanged, 10);

})();`

Considering that this script is loaded (and evaluated) **after** the field has
been created, it has two big disadvantages:

* As for any polling mechanism, it uselessly consumes CPU on a regular basis.

* Because of the timer use, the detection occurs only when the JavaScript engine
has some free CPU time to executes the function.

Indeed, the following code will generate trouble:
`document.getElementById("hiddenFieldID").value = 1;
// Some code
document.getElementById("hiddenFieldID").value = 2;`

Only the value "2" would be seen.

Worst case, let say that the last value detected was "2", then no change would
be detected.

### Second attempt: hooking "set"

After reading an interesting article about one of the new features of the
ECMAScript 5.1: [Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty), I wanted to
see if Chrome would allow me to redefine the value property of the hidden field.

I tried the following:

`(function () {/*gpf:apply-jshint*/
    "use strict";

    function actionToBeTriggered(/*value*/) {
        // What needs to be done when the value changed
    }

    Object.defineProperty(document.getElementById("hiddenFieldID"), "value", {
        get: function () { return 0; },
        set: actionToBeTriggered
    });

})();`

And... it worked.

This solution, beside the questionable support of such a mechanism, allowed me
to hook a callback that was called every time the value was changed.

### Conclusion

Once the patch has been delivered, we decided that the hidden field was no more
necessary and replaced it with a direct call to the function.
