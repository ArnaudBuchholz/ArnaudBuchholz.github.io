    This version 0.2.2 is still in progress. Here is a sneak peek of the build process.
</div>
<code class="markdown">

When building the [GPF library](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js), it is tested with 4 command line hosts:
    * [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org/)
    * [cscript/wscript](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490887.aspx)
    * [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino)
    * [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

And at least 3 browsers:
    * [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)
    * [Safari](http://appldnld.apple.com/Safari5/041-5487.20120509.INU8B/SafariSetup.exe)
    * Internet Explorer

Backward compatibility with all previous versions is checked as well as maintainability ratio (using
[Plato](https://github.com/es-analysis/plato)) and coverage (using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)).

The library is published in three flavors:
    * source (development version)
    * debug (concatenated sources)
    * release (an optimized and [uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)-ed version of debug)

The test library contains more than 600 unit tests covering almost 100% of the code (exceptions are
[documented](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COVERAGE.html)).

Last but not least, the code is [linted](https://eslint.org/) and documentation is generated with
[jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/).

This represents a total of 55 test executions.

Obviously, I am too lazy to do it all by myself: everything is automated with [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/).

Today was a big day working on [version 0.2.2](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/10) (still in
progress): I am finalizing a feature that will help me better
[modularize my code](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/168).

I wanted to share those 2 minutes of pure development joy that concluded my work *(full screen recommended)*.
