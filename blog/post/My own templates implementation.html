## It's been a long time...

OK, I have to admit that the blog is not really active... I should probably write more often. It's not because of
[procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination) but rather a
[time management issue](https://youtu.be/zhAmug6Ts6o).

A [backlog](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AArticle) of
articles I would like to write is maintained and I also created a task on my
[Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/front/#?memberId=54a5210c-0e2b-4e21-b99c-ee27062f1bd6) as a reminder to fill the
blog.

So you may wonder what do I spend my time on?

A lot of personal - good and bad - events, a new [framework](http://openui5.org/) to learn and a deep code refactoring
[to improve maintainability](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/metrics.js#L158-L193) are taking
most of it.

But in between everything I still have some rare occasions of fun and I started this
[microproject](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microproject) one week ago.

## The need

In [my library](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js), the source and test files are organised with the help of one
special configuration file: [sources.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/sources.json).
It is the [vertebral column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column) of the project as all the tools related to
building, testing or even documenting are based on it.

(...) Documentation generation relies on [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) and a
[grunt plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-jsdoc) but the code base needs some additional cleanup.
Consequently only few files are actually considered.

This JSON storage lists files and associates properties to them:
* Textual description of the source content
* Flag to know if it has a test counterpart
* Optional flag to allow documentation extraction
* Optional documentation flags that stress out the most important parts of the source (such as class implementation,
main method name...)

Because I try to isolate concepts as much as possible, it quickly grew from [134 lines in April](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/7362fbc4685b5aefecb856aa5f984f59e7497411/src/sources.json) to
[334 lines in June](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/022ae58401e7415812d443dd9963cdd71f8efc77/src/
sources.json), all entered manually (with lots of errors leading to "what is going on?",
"oh no, nothing works again...").

At some point I deserve a little bit of control on this file content not only to enforce its syntax but also to have a
better view on what it contains.

So I decided it would be nice to develop an HTML view on this one.

## Building HTML pages

Long story short, it all started with a simple list formatting the file content.
Updating will come later.
Hence a basic [HTML page](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/sources.html) was created to display a
table (I know... not really responsive but this is not required for now).

Loading the JSON file using an AJAX request and iterate over its content is easy but then...

Several solution exists:

### Build HTML nodes using script

Browsers now offer a complete (and standardized) API to manipulate the
[Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).
It allows you to programmatically fill the page the same way you would do with static HTML code.

**PROS**
* Fast
* Full control on the generation
* Can be debugged

**CONS**
* Complex and exhaustive API
* Takes more time to develop
* Long code for simple output
* Code is quite cryptic and hard to evolve
* Not easily maintainable

[Code sample](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My%20own%20templates%20implementation/Code.html)
`var data = {
    title: "Code sample",
    id: "test",
    checked: "checked",
    label: "it works"
};
var h1 = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("h1"));
h1.innerHTML = data.title;
var input = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("input"));
input.setAttribute("id", data.id);
input.setAttribute("type", "checkbox");
input.setAttribute("checked", "");
var label = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("label"));
label.setAttribute("for", data.id);
label.setAttribute("title", data.label);
label.innerHTML = data.label;`

### Use a template engine

Template engines usually rely on a static description of the final output.
The documented syntax proposes placeholders to represent substitution points.
Depending on the engine, there might be several ways to inject the values.
They are designed to be fast, offer manipulation helpers (such as enumeration) and extensive bindings (with
typing, transformation...).

**PROS**
* Quite fast (depends on the engine)
* Less code to develop
* Rapid learning curve

**CONS**
* Each engine has its conventions and api
* Debugging

[Mustache sample](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My%20own%20templates%20implementation/Mustache.html)
`var html = Mustache.to_html(document.getElementById("tpl").innerHTML, {
    title: "Mustache sample",
    id: "test",
    checked: "checked",
    label: "it works"
});
document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("div")).innerHTML = html;`

where the template is defined as:
`&lt;script id="tpl" type="text/template"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;input id="{{id}}" type="checkbox" {{checked}}&gt;&lt;label for="{{id}}" title="{{label}}"&gt;{{label}}&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;`

### Use a framework

Pros: well tested and honestly fast
Cons: heavy, a nightmare to debug if anything goes wrong. Have to
follow framework design concepts ($scope).

[Angular sample](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My%20own%20templates%20implementation/Angular.html)
`var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

myApp.controller('SampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
    $scope.title = "Angular sample";
    $scope.id="test";
    $scope.checked=true;
    $scope.label="it works";
}]);`

where the body is defined as:
`&lt;body ng-controller="SampleController"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;input id="{{id}}" type="checkbox" ng-checked="checked"&gt;&lt;label for="{{id}}" title="{{label}}"&gt;{{label}}&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;`

I am a big fan of Vanilla JS: the idea is not to rej







    Please note that I have nothing against the framework itself, it's
    just too much with regards to what I'l trying to do here.

    Building a simple template engine

    Because I am curious, I searched around and found some interesting
    ideas about DOM template element and I wanted to experiment it.

    The expected key benefits are:
    - flexible way to define HTML
    - ease of use
    - flexible way to customize it:
    Binding, attributes adding (checkbox), conditionnal insertion

    I prefer declaration over implementation, that's probably why I use
    grunt instead of gulp. One reason is that I believe in less code means
    less bugs. Furthermore, when the parser already exists (the browser in
    our case), this enforces rhe syntax and eases a little bit more the
    implementation.


    The template tag is an HTML element that accepts any HTML content. It
    is parsed but not rendered. When you access it, this DOM element looks
    like a document fragment and its content can be read or altered almost
    like any other element. What is also nice is that it may contain more
    than one node v

    Code generation

    The first version of this templating helper was returning a fonction
    that not only tokenized the HTML of the template but also substituted
    the tokens.
    Then I realized that it would be faster to tokenize the content first
    and then returning a function doing the substitution job.
    Hence I rewrote it to dynamically build the template fonction based on
    the template.

    Until recently I was not a big fan of regular expression. I was under
    the impression rhat they were slow and useless because they were only
    telling you if a string respects a given pattern.
    Then I read the book "Javascript the good parts" from Crockford and
    the chapter X was an eye opener. Indeed, on top of matching a pattern
    you can also extract specifc information from it using parenthesis
    (ref to mdn).

    I have a real fascination for the process of generating code: the
    outcome is most of the time faster than the traditional way of doing
    things because it produces highly specialized functions.
    There are two ways to generate code:
    - eval
    - the Function constructor

    There is a third way which combines benefits of the two others but
    with an additional complexity: loading dynamically generated sources
    (either by inserting a new script tag whose content is generated or by
    loading a script from the data URL).

    In general eval is a bad idea: it merges the content with the global
    scope and it is an open door for code injection. Use script brought
    some security mechanism but most linters would reject it. And I agree:
    eval is evil.

    On the other hand, new Function builds the function in a isolated scope:
