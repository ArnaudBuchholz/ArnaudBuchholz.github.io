## It's been a long time...

OK, I have to admit that the blog is not really active... I should probably write more often. It's not because of
[procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination) but rather a
[time management issue](https://youtu.be/zhAmug6Ts6o). Furthermore, writing takes me a lot of time as I always review
the article several times before publishing. Still, I may have missed typos and other mistakes, so don't hesitate to
give feedback...

A [backlog](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AArticle) of
articles I would like to write is maintained and I also created a task on my
[Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/front/#?memberId=54a5210c-0e2b-4e21-b99c-ee27062f1bd6) as a reminder to fill the
blog.

So you may wonder what do I spend my time on?

A lot of personal - good and bad - events, a new [framework](http://openui5.org/) to learn and a deep code refactoring
[to improve maintainability](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/metrics.js#L158-L193) are taking
most of it.

But in between everything I still have some rare occasions of fun and I started this
[microproject](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microproject) recently.

## The need

In [the GPF-JS library](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js), the source and test files are organised with the help
of one special configuration file:
[sources.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/sources.json).
It is the [vertebral column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column) of the project as all the tools related to
building, testing or even documenting are based on it.

(...) Documentation generation relies on [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) and a
[grunt plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-jsdoc) but the code base needs some additional cleanup.
Consequently only few files are currently considered.

This JSON storage lists files and associates properties to them:
* Textual description of the source content
* Flag to know if it has a test counterpart
* Optional flag to allow documentation extraction
* Optional documentation flags that stress out the most important parts of the source (such as class implementation,
main method name...)

Because concepts are isolated as much as possible, this file quickly grew from [134 lines in April](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/7362fbc4685b5aefecb856aa5f984f59e7497411/src/sources.json) to
[334 lines in June](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/022ae58401e7415812d443dd9963cdd71f8efc77/src/
sources.json), all entered manually (with lots of errors leading to "what is going on?",
"oh no, nothing works again...").

At some point its content deserved a little bit of [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_freak) not only to
enforce the syntax but also to have a better view on what it contains.

So I decided it would be nice to develop an HTML view on this one.

## Building HTML pages

Long story short, it all started with a simple list formatting the file content.
Updating will come later.
Hence a basic [HTML page](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/sources.html) was created to display a
table (not really responsive but this is not required for now).

Loading the JSON file using an [AJAX request](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/res/xhr.js) and
iterating over its content is easy but then...

Several solution exists:

### Build HTML nodes using script

Browsers [now](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-evolution-of-the-web-in-a-blink) offer a complete
(and standardized) API to manipulate the
[Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).
It allows you to programmatically fill the page the same way you would do with static HTML code.

**PROS**
* Fast
* Full control on the generation
* Can be debugged

**CONS**
* Exhaustive but complex API
* Takes more time to develop
* Long code for simple output
* Code is quite cryptic and hard to evolve
* Not easily maintainable

[Code sample](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My%20own%20templates%20implementation/Code.html)
`var data = {
    title: "Code sample",
    id: "test",
    checked: "checked",
    label: "it works"
};
var h1 = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("h1"));
h1.innerHTML = data.title;
var input = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("input"));
input.setAttribute("id", data.id);
input.setAttribute("type", "checkbox");
input.setAttribute("checked", "");
var label = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("label"));
label.setAttribute("for", data.id);
label.setAttribute("title", data.label);
label.innerHTML = data.label;`

### Use a template engine

Template engines usually rely on a static description of the final output.
The documented syntax proposes placeholders to represent substitution points.
Depending on the engine, there might be several ways to inject the values.
They are designed to be fast, offer common helpers (such as enumeration) and extensive bindings (with
typing, transformation...).

**PROS**
* Quite fast (depends on the engine)
* Less code to develop
* Easy to maintain
* Rapid learning curve

**CONS**
* Each engine has its conventions and API
* Debugging

[Mustache sample](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My%20own%20templates%20implementation/Mustache.html)
`var html = Mustache.to_html(document.getElementById("tpl").innerHTML, {
    title: "Mustache sample",
    id: "test",
    checked: "checked",
    label: "it works"
});
document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("div")).innerHTML = html;`

where the template is defined as:
<code class="html">&lt;</span><span class="s1">script </span><span class="s0">id=</span><span class="s2">&quot;tpl&quot; </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;text/template&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;
    &lt;</span><span class="s1">h1</span><span class="s0">&gt;{{title}}&lt;/</span><span class="s1">h1</span><span class="s0">&gt;
    &lt;</span><span class="s1">input </span><span class="s0">id=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{{id}}&quot; </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checkbox&quot; </span><span class="s0">{{checked}}&gt;
    &lt;</span><span class="s1">label </span><span class="s0">for=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{{id}}&quot; </span><span class="s0">title=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{{label}}&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;{{label}}&lt;/</span><span class="s1">label</span><span class="s0">&gt;
&lt;/</span><span class="s1">script</span><span class="s0">&gt;</span></code>

(...) A quick note about the script tag with type="text/template", it is a trick that prevents the browser to actually
execute the content of the script tag. However, it remains available for any custom coding.

Sample reference:
[mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js)

### Use a framework

To put it in a nutshell, a framework will convert any web page into a web application: it encapsulates more than just UI
definition and behaviors.

(...) I recommend reading this
[manifesto against frameworks](http://bitworking.org/news/2014/05/zero_framework_manifesto), it draws the line between
libraries and frameworks

This being said,
[each framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) has its
own specificities but, regarding UI building, I would distinguish 2 main types:
* Widget based frameworks (ExtJS, Open UI5...): each UI element is wrapped inside a control class.
Building the interface can be done either through static descriptions (such as XML) or code.
* HTML based frameworks (AngularJS, EmberJS...): based on HTML, it is then augmented with bindings

**PROS**
* Codebase (samples, documentation...)
* Application oriented (does more than templating)

**CONS**
* Heavy
* Long learning curve
* May become a nightmare to debug if anything goes wrong
* Design may look rigid

[Angular sample](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My%20own%20templates%20implementation/Angular.html)
`var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

myApp.controller('SampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
    $scope.title = "Angular sample";
    $scope.id="test";
    $scope.checked=true;
    $scope.label="it works";
}]);`

where the body is defined as:
<code class="html"><span class="s0">&lt;</span><span class="s1">html </span><span class="s0">ng-app=</span><span class="s2">&quot;myApp&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;
    </span><span class="s3">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><span class="s0">
    &lt;</span><span class="s1">body </span><span class="s0">ng-controller=</span><span class="s2">&quot;SampleController&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;
        &lt;</span><span class="s1">h1</span><span class="s0">&gt;{{title}}&lt;/</span><span class="s1">h1</span><span class="s0">&gt;
        &lt;</span><span class="s1">input </span><span class="s0">id=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{{id}}&quot; </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checkbox&quot; </span><span class="s0">ng-checked=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checked&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;
        &lt;</span><span class="s1">label </span><span class="s0">for=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{{id}}&quot; </span><span class="s0">title=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{{label}}&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;{{label}}&lt;/</span><span class="s1">label</span><span class="s0">&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span class="s1">body</span><span class="s0">&gt;
&lt;/</span><span class="s1">html</span><span class="s0">&gt;</span></code>

Sample reference:
[Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/)

## Building a simple template engine

A framework could be used but it's just too much with regards to what has to be achieved.
And, obviously, mustache is appropriate but I would have missed an opportunity to
[learn new things](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/learn-something-new-every-day.html).

Regarding the requirements, the expected benefits of the new template engine are:
* Flexible and easy way to define valid HTML
* Simple textual bindings
* JavaScript injection

The engine must generate a function accepting at least two parameters:
* An object providing values for substitution
* An index that will distinguish objects when used in an enumeration

The result will be a set of DOM nodes.

In terms of syntax, the following patterns will be accepted in the template definition:
* **{{fieldName}}** to be replaced with the object's field named fieldName: it can be used inside any textual content
(attributes or textual nodes).
* **{% JAVASCRIPT CODE %}** to inject JavaScript *(with some limitations, see below)*


JavaScript helpers will be provided inside the injected code to condition / alter the output:
* **$write()** to output any HTML code *(to be used carefully)*

* **$object** gives the current object
* **$index** gives the current index

### The checkbox case

Most of the content to generate simply consists in replacing placeholders with text coming from the object
(source name, description...). It can be either as a textual node (in between elements) or as an attribute value
(like for ids...).

However, an unexpected challenge appeared when it came to render boolean options.

Indeed, the simpler way to represent a boolean is to use an
[input with type set to checkbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).

But the checkbox will be ticked or not depending on the presence of the checked attribute, whatever its value.

So the template engine must offer a way to alter an element definition by adding attributes.

Working on the syntax, I tried different approaches. The first attempt looked like this:
<code class="html"><span class="s0">&lt;</span><span class="s1">input </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checkbox&quot; </span><span class="s0">{% JAVASCRIPT CODE %}&gt;</span></code>

This one is simple however, the parsed result generates a strange HTML string:
<code class="javascript gpf-blog"><span class="string">"&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" {%=\"\" javascript=\"\" code=\"\" %}=\"\"&gt;"</span></code>

(...) One easy way to find out this parsed result is to open the debugger, grab the handle of the parent element and
ask for the [innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) property.

Indeed, each block of characters is recognized as a single attribute.

So, I tried the following one:
<code class="html"><span class="s0">&lt;</span><span class="s1">input </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checkbox&quot; </span><span class="s0">{%%}=</span><span class="s2">&quot;JAVASCRIPT CODE&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;</span></code>

And this time, the string looked good:
<code class="javascript gpf-blog"><span class="string">"&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" {%%}=\"JAVASCRIPT CODE\"&gt;"</span></code>

(...) This also implies that the JavaScript code is correctly escaped to fit an attribute value. For instance, it may
use single quotes for strings instead of double quotes.

(...) Re-reading this part, I realize I could also use an attribute named {isChecked} and set the field isChecked with
"checked" or "anything" depending if I want the checkbox to be ticked or not.
However, in that case, the value has to be pre-formatted which is something I want to avoid.

### The template tag

Let say you want to define a configuration file that has to be used by a JavaScript application. How would you define
its syntax and content? Some may invent a dedicated API and request the file to be a valid JavaScript program.
Other may specify a syntax to set the configuration in a declarative way.

Each version has its advantages and drawbacks:
* the programmatic approach maximizes the capacities when setting the configuration (environment detection, conditions,
loops...) but with a cost in terms of maintenance, compatibility and migration
* the declarative approach simplifies the file but also gives limits to what you can do with it

In my opinion, declaration has to be preferred over implementation,
that's probably why I use [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) instead of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
The main reason is that less code means less bugs.

When the [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) already exists (the browser in our case or the JSON format for
the previous example), this enforces the syntax and makes the implementation even easier.

The [template element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) is an HTML tag that
accepts any HTML content. When you access it, this DOM element exposes a
[content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template#Attributes) property that can be used and
altered almost like any other element.

Also, you can access the [innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) member.

(...) Please note that this element is [not supported by IE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/
Element/template#Browser_compatibility)

Actually, almost any HTML element could be used the same way. However the template one has two significant advantages:
* It is parsed but not rendered: it speeds up the loading of the page and no special handling is required to hide it
* It accepts any HTML content: try setting innerHTML to "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;" on a
[DIV element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div), it won't accept it.

So - after few modifications - here is the template content illustrating all features:

<code class="html"><span class="s0">&lt;</span><span class="s1">body</span><span class="s0">&gt;
    &lt;</span><span class="s1">template </span><span class="s0">id=</span><span class="s2">&quot;tpl_row&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;
{%
        function check(a, b) {
            if ($object[a] &amp;&amp; (b === undefined || $object[b])) {
                $write(&quot;checked&quot;);
            }
        }
%}
        &lt;</span><span class="s1">tr</span><span class="s0">&gt;
            &lt;</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;{{name}}&lt;/</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;
            &lt;</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;{{description}}&lt;/</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;
            &lt;</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="s1">input </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checkbox&quot; </span><span class="s0">{%%}=</span><span class="s2">&quot;check('load');&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;
            &lt;</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="s1">input </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checkbox&quot; </span><span class="s0">{%%}=</span><span class="s2">&quot;check('load', 'test');&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;
            &lt;</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="s1">input </span><span class="s0">type=</span><span class="s2">&quot;checkbox&quot; </span><span class="s0">{%%}=</span><span class="s2">&quot;check('doc');&quot;</span><span class="s0">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="s1">td</span><span class="s0">&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span class="s1">tr</span><span class="s0">&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span class="s1">template</span><span class="s0">&gt;
&lt;/</span><span class="s1">body</span><span class="s0">&gt;
</span></code>

### Tokenizing

Now that we have a content, let see how we can isolate each part in order to distinguish the static text from the places
where replacements are required. This process is called
[tokenizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_%28lexical_analysis%29).

Until recently I was not a big fan of
[regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).
I was under the impression that they were slow and useless
because they were only telling you if a string respects a given pattern.

Then I read the book
[JavaScript The Good Parts](https://www.google.ca/search?q=Javascript+the+good+parts) from
[Douglas Crockford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford). The chapter 7 was an eye opener.
Indeed, on top of matching a pattern (and give you information about what and where), it can also extract specific
information from it using capturing groups (parenthesis).

I also strongly recommend reading [this website](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) that provides valuable
information about the engine.

Regarding performances, they can be efficient or very slow depending on how you write them, check the following
documentation:

* [Regex Performance from Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/regex-performance/)

* [Regexes: The Bad, the Better, and the Best](https://www.loggly.com/blog/regexes-the-bad-better-best/)

* [Comparing the Efficiency of Regular Expressions](https://www.regexbuddy.com/manual/benchmark.html)

(...) There are still some situations where JavaScript regexes are not appropriate. For instance, when the string you
want to match is a stream you need a [text-directed](http://www.regular-expressions.info/engine.html) engine that can
be interrupted. I started to implement
[such a mechanism](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/71afe8db96e1637524ff146721a56f955eb0bf12/src/
pattern.js) ([tested](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/71afe8db96e1637524ff146721a56f955eb0bf12/test/
pattern.js)) in GPF-JS.

So, for each pattern, a regular expression is capable of finding it and extracting its content:

* [Matching field name](https://regex101.com/r/cS5wD1/3)

* [Matching attribute injection](https://regex101.com/r/aC9aQ8/1)

* [Matching textual injection](https://regex101.com/r/rO6yC6/1)

Once the three are combined with an additional default case, it gives the
[tokenizing pattern](https://regex101.com/r/uB7tR4/1).

From there, the algorithm consists in matching the string through this regular expression and process each token one by
one.

(...) Don't forget to reset the [lastIndex property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Global_Objects/RegExp/lastIndex) before matching a new string.

### Code generation

If you were patient enough to read this article until this part: congratulations! You have reached the funniest part of
it.

The first version of the helper was returning a function that was not only tokenizing the HTML of the template but also
substituting the tokens all together. Then I realized that it would be faster to tokenize the content first and then
generate a function that does only the substitution job.

Hence I rewrote it to dynamically build the template function based on the template description.

I have a real fascination for the process of code generation: the outcome is most of the time faster than the
traditional way of doing things because it produces highly specialized functions.

There are several ways to generate code in JavaScript, the two most commons are:
* [eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval)
* [Function constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)

(...) There are other ways which are more elaborated. For instance, one may also load a script from a
[data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs). But let's keep things simple.

In general eval is a bad idea: it merges the content within the global scope and it is an open door for unwanted code
injection or unexpected side effects. [Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Strict_mode) brings some security mechanisms but most linters will reject it anyway. And I agree:
[eval is evil](http://jslint.fantasy.codes/eval-is-evil/).

On the other hand, the Function constructor builds the new function in an isolated scope. This is an extreme opposite
because, as a result, you can't access any symbols of your app. Still, it is an open door to code injection if you
don't control what you put in the function body but, at least, the impact will be limited.

(...) Most script engines offers an access point to the main contextual object (a.k.a the top level scope), i.e.
[window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) for browsers or
[global](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global) in NodeJS. You may also access it by calling a function
with a null scope in a non-strict environment. From there, you can access all global definitions.

(...) I also recommend this interesting article [Writing a JavaScript framework -
Sandboxed code evaluation](https://blog.risingstack.com/writing-a-javascript-framework-sandboxed-code-evaluation/): it
proposes an ES6 alternative to create sandboxed environments.

The [factory builder](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/b0fd9ae18c2f79c866debcafacc954eb8bcec518/res/
tpl.js#L36-L69) maintain an array of code lines (named **code**) to finally
[create the function](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/b0fd9ae18c2f79c866debcafacc954eb8bcec518/res/
tpl.js#L68).

The best way to explain how it works is to show the result on the samples used in the test scenarios.

(...) The generated functions were extracted using [chrome development tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/
chrome-devtools) and reformatted with the help of the [pretty print](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/
chrome-devtools/debug/readability/pretty-print) button.

Let's start with the [sample 1](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/b0fd9ae18c2f79c866debcafacc954eb8bcec518/
test/host/mocha/tpl.html#L169):

`(function() {
    var __a = arguments
      , $object = __a[0]
      , $index = __a[1]
      , __r = []
      , __d = document
      , __t = __d.createElement("template");
    function __s(v) {
        if (undefined === v)
            return "";
        return v.toString();
    }
    function $write(t) {
        __r.push(__s(t));
    }
    __r.push("This is a static one");
    __t.innerHTML = __r.join("");
    return __d.importNode(__t.content, true);
}
)`

Because the template allows JavaScript injection, it is important to make sure that the injected code won't collide with
the one that ensures the template mechanics (basically everything but the line containing "This is a static one").
I still remember this funny [PHP warning](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php) about using __ in names so I
decided to prefix the internal names with it.

So you have:
* **__a** shortcut to [arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
* **__d** shortcut to [document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)
* **__r** the result HTML array (array is used to speed up concatenation)
* **__t** a new template element (that will receive the result HTML code)
* **__s** a method that converts its parameter into a string (required for $write and basic binding)

Now if we take a look at [sample 4](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
b0fd9ae18c2f79c866debcafacc954eb8bcec518/test/host/mocha/tpl.html#L172): it introduces simple binding
($object.title and $object.content).

<code class="javascript">(function() {
    var __a = arguments
      , $object = __a[0]
      , $index = __a[1]
      , __r = []
      , __d = document
      , __t = __d.createElement("template");
    function __s(v) {
        if (undefined === v)
            return "";
        return v.toString();
    }
    function $write(t) {
        __r.push(__s(t));
    }
    __r.push("<h1>;");
    __r.push(__s($object.title));
    __r.push("</h1>;");
    __r.push(__s($object.content));
    __t.innerHTML = __r.join("");
    return __d.importNode(__t.content, true);
}
)</code>

The pattern {{**name**}} is replaced with __r.push(__s($object.**name**));

[Sample 7](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/b0fd9ae18c2f79c866debcafacc954eb8bcec518/test/host/mocha/
tpl.html#L175) illustrates the attribute version of code injection.

<code class="javascript">(function() {
    var __a = arguments
      , $object = __a[0]
      , $index = __a[1]
      , __r = []
      , __d = document
      , __t = __d.createElement("template");
    function __s(v) {
        if (undefined === v)
            return "";
        return v.toString();
    }
    function $write(t) {
        __r.push(__s(t));
    }
    __r.push("&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" ");
    if ($object.check)
        $write('checked=\'true\'');
    __r.push(">");
    __t.innerHTML = __r.join("");
    return __d.importNode(__t.content, true);
}
)</code>

The code is inserted 'as-is' in the result function.

Lastly, [sample 8](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/b0fd9ae18c2f79c866debcafacc954eb8bcec518/test/host/
mocha/tpl.html#L176) shows JavaScript injection to condition generation:
<code class="javascript">(function() {
    var __a = arguments
      , $object = __a[0]
      , $index = __a[1]
      , __r = []
      , __d = document
      , __t = __d.createElement("template");
    function __s(v) {
        if (undefined === v)
            return "";
        return v.toString();
    }
    function $write(t) {
        __r.push(__s(t));
    }
    if ($object.condition) {
        __r.push("<span>");
        $write("Hello");
        __r.push("</span>");
    } else {
        __r.push("<div></div>");
    }
    __t.innerHTML = __r.join("");
    return __d.importNode(__t.content, true);
}
)</code>

Same solution here: the code is copied [verbatim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbatim) to the function body.

### Testing

Of course, as a convinced practitioner of [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), I created
[test scenarios](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/mocha/tpl.html) to validate the most
common use cases of this template library.
