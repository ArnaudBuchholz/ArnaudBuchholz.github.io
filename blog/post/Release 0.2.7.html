## Release content

### A smaller release

As announced during the release of [version 0.2.6](http://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2018/05/release-026-gpfrequirejs.html),
the month of June was busy developing a [sample application](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/training-ui5con18-opa)
to support the [UICon'18 conference](https://youtu.be/HiZq-kuIbt0).

Unexpectedly, another **interesting project** emerged from this development but this will be detailed later on the blog.

In the end, the **bandwidth was limited** to work on this release.

### XML Serialization

This version introduces the
[IXmlContentHandler](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IXmlContentHandler.html) interface as well
as the [gpf.xml.Writer](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.xml.Writer.html) class to **enable
[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) writing**.

If you are not familiar with the [Simple API for XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML), there are tons
of existing implementation in different languages.
The [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/sax/parsing.html) one is considered to be **normative**.

To put it in a nutshell, **SAX proposes an interface to parse  and generate XML**.

(...) The parsing part might be implemented later, only the generation one is required today.

Here is an example of an XML generation piped to a string buffer:

`const
    writer = new gpf.xml.Writer(),
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableString();
gpf.stream.pipe(writer, output).then(() => {
    console.log(output.toString());
});
writer.startDocument()
    .then(() => writer.startElement("document"))
    .then(() => writer.startElement("a"))
    .then(() => writer.startElement("b"))
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.startElement("c"))
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.endElement())
    .then(() => writer.endDocument());`

Which leads to the following output:
<pre>&lt;document&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;b/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;c/&gt;&lt;/document&gt;</pre>

Representing the following structure:
<pre>document
|
+- a
|  |
|  +- b
|
+- c</pre>

Since all the methods returns a promise, the syntax is quite **tedious**.
When writing the [first tests](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
f506c20d2ad16bffc33f188d94a1151aa5705f50/test/xml/writer.js), it quickly became clear that its complexity could be
greatly reduced by augmenting the result promise with the interface methods.

As a result, a [wrapper](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/6478d94ebfe547c3df5a4e4c4ab83966591781f8/test/
xml/writer.js#L6-L26) was designed to **simplify the tests** leading to this improved syntax:

`const
    writer = new gpf.xml.Writer(),
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableString();
gpf.stream.pipe(writer, output).then(() => {
    console.log(output.toString());
});
wrap(writer).startDocument()
    .startElement("document")
    .startElement("a")
    .startElement("b")
    .endElement()
    .endElement()
    .startElement("c")
    .endElement()
    .endElement()
    .endDocument();`

This will [surely](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/272) be standardized in a future version.

### Improved gpf.require

#### Preloading

The goal of the library is to support application development. As explained in the article
[My own require implementation](http://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2018/01/my-own-require-implementation.html), splitting the
code into **modules enforces better code**. However, at some point, all these modules must be consolidated to **speed up
the application loading**.

This version offers the possibility to **preload** the sources by passing a dictionary mapping the resources path
to their textual content. As a result, when the resource is required, it does not need to be loaded.

Here is the proposed bootstrap implementation:

`gpf.http.get("preload.json")
    .then(function (response) {
        if (response.status === 200) {
            return JSON.parse(response.responseText);
        }
        return Promise.reject();
    })
    .then(function (preload) {
        gpf.require.configure({
            preload: preload
        });
    })
    .catch(function (reason) {
        // Document and/or absorb errors
    })
    .then(function () {
        gpf.require.define({
            app: "app.js" // Might be preloaded
        }, function (require) {
            require.app.start();
        });
    });`

#### Modern browsers

One of the challenges of building a feature-specific version of the library (a.k.a. flavor) is to test it with **modern
browsers** only. The [compatibility layer](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html) of the
library takes a **significant part** of it and is useless if the flavor's target is NodeJS or any recent browser.

Worst, while building the release, the tests were failing when 'old' browsers were configured.

So, the concurrent task was [modified](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/grunt/concurrent.js#L12-L15)
to include a [condition](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/grunt/concurrent.js#L75) on modern
browsers.

These are considered modern:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari (if on Mac)

### Quality improvement

#### Abstract classes

Quality is also about providing tools to make sure that developers don't make mistake. Abstract classes concept is one
of them. This version offers the possibility to create **abstract classes** by adding
[$abstract](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/test/define.js#L313-L373) in their definition.

(...) If one wants to deal with abstract methods, they can be defined with gpf.Error.abstractMethod. However, this won't
prevent class instantiation.

#### Debugging with sources

Debugging the library can be laborious. I am more familiar with Chrome development tools and I sometimes use them
with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).
Because the sources are loading through the [evil-ish](http://linterrors.com/js/eval-is-evil)
use of [eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/eval), they **don't appear
in the debugger sources tab**.

![No sources](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.7/before.png)

To solve that problem, [source maps](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) were applied.

To put it in a nutshell:
* Test files loading [injects
sourceURL](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/test/host/web_loader.js#L48) before evaluation
* A special version of the [boot.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/test/host/web_loader.js#L207)
file is handled by a [new
middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/grunt/connect-middleware/sources.js). It generates a
unique source file (sources.js) with its corresponding source map thanks to
[uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).

As a result, sources appear:

![With sources](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.7/after.png)

#### Hosted automated code review

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a huge source of information. While browsing some repositories, I discovered two code
review services that integrates nicely.

* [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js)
* [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/project/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/dashboard)

They both focus on **code quality** (based on static checks) and propose exhaustive report on potential issues or code
smells found in your code.

Today, **only the [src](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/src) folder of the repository is submitted
for review**.

It revealed some interesting issues such as:
* Code similarities, i.e. opportunity for code refactoring

* Code complexities:

Some were already known and have been addressed in this version (in particular
[src/compatibility/promise.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/src/compatibility/promise.js) where
plato was giving a little
[74.46](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/plato/files/src_compatibility_promise_js/index.html)).

The surprise came from a **class definition with more than 20 methods** as it was considered an issue
([src/xml/writer.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/ebee2a06417401cbbaabd89f8fa65a43bb7ec943/
src/xml/writer.js)).
After having diligently improved the code, by **isolating the
[XML validation helpers](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/src/xml/check.js)**, one must admit that
it makes things more [readable](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.7/src/xml/writer.js) !

Finally, these tools **rank the overall quality** with a score that can be inserted in the project readme.

![Quality scores](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.7/quality.png)

## Lessons learned

From a pure development prospective, **a lot was done in a very limited time**.
Since the quality of the code is **enforced** by the usual best practices (TDD, static code validation) but also
**measured** (with plato), modifications are safe and immediately validated.

A lot was learned on [JavaScript source mappings](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)
since it was required to enable debugging in the browser.

The relevance of the problems raised by the Code Climate tool was quit surprising: the **overall project
quality benefited from this integration**.

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/16) is not even defined.
For the next months, I will focus on a side project that requires all my attention.
