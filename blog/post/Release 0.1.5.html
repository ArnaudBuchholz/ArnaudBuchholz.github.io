## It's finally out !

Almost one two years ago, I was experimenting NPM release and the version 0.1.4 was going out.
Then, I started to focus on quality and automation and I reworked most of it.

### Source management

### Quality with Plato

### TDD

### Automation

### Grunt web integration

As I am to lazy to remember all the grunt tasks, I decided to create a small web interface that would offer me all
the interactions I need.
