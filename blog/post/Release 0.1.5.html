## It's finally out !

Almost two years ago, I was experimenting [NPM publication](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) and the
version [0.1.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js) went out.

At that time, I had no clear road map or vision of what I wanted to do with this library.
Long story short, I was trying to consolidate my JavaScript know-how in order to re-create (in a better way) a library
that I created in a previous company.

If you check the [package.json history](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commits/master/package.json),
version 0.1.5 'officially' started on [November 26th, 2015](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/
f117eb8ba9f0c7aaf08ce65fb3c893e2b01e322b). This was after I added some [grunt packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) to
automate linting ([jshint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) and
[ESlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-eslint)) as well as testing (mocha
[1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mocha), [2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mocha-test)
and istanbul [1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-istanbul),
[2] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-istanbul-coverage)).

Clearly, the goal shifted from coding only to automating, testing and checking quality.

In this journey, I faced many problems, some of them are already [documented](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/).

### Source management

### Quality with Plato

### TDD

### Automation

### Grunt web integration

As I am to lazy to remember all the grunt tasks, I decided to create a small web interface that would offer me all
the interactions I need.
