## It's finally out !

Almost two years ago, I was experimenting [NPM publication](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) and the
version [0.1.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js) went out.

At that time, I had no clear road map or even a vision of what I wanted to do with the
[GPF-JS library](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js).
Long story short, I was trying to consolidate my JavaScript know-how in order to re-create (in a better way) a library
that I started in a previous company.

If you check the [package.json history](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commits/master/package.json),
version 0.1.5 'officially' started on [November 26th, 2015](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/
f117eb8ba9f0c7aaf08ce65fb3c893e2b01e322b). This was after I added some [grunt packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) to
automate linting ([jshint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) and
[ESlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-eslint)) as well as testing (mocha
[1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mocha), [2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mocha-test)
and istanbul [1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-istanbul),
[2] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-istanbul-coverage)).

Clearly, the goal shifted from coding to automating, testing and checking quality.
And that probably explains why I needed a full year to achieve this version.

## What's inside?

Well... that's embarrassing but... almost nothing.
Indeed, if you check the [documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html), only
[few functions](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html) and one
[class](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.Error.html) are available for now.

![That's suspicious](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/futurama-suspicious.jpg)

At least, the library provides a
[compatibility layer](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html) for all
[supported environments](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-LOADING.html).

But, still, you might wonder: what did I spend my year on?

To put it in a nutshell, I focused more on the how than on the what.

## From Grunt command line to Web interface

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) has been implemented to automate lots of tasks.

When I use grunt --help, the following commands are listed:
`    concurrent  Run grunt tasks concurrently *
       connect  Start a connect web server. *
          copy  Copy files. *
        jshint  Validate files with JSHint. *
        uglify  Minify files with UglifyJS. *
         watch  Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.
        eslint  Validate files with ESLint *
          exec  Execute shell commands. *
      htmllint  HTML5 linter and validator. *
    instrument  instruments a file or a directory tree
   reloadTasks  override instrumented tasks
 storeCoverage  store coverage from global
    makeReport  make coverage report
      coverage  check coverage thresholds *
         jsdoc  Generates source documentation using jsdoc *
         mocha  Run Mocha unit tests in a headless PhantomJS instance. *
     mochaTest  Run node unit tests with Mocha *
        notify  Show an arbitrary notification whenever you need. *
  notify_hooks  Config the automatic notification hooks.
        chrome  Alias for "connectIf", "exec:testChromeVerbose" tasks.
       firefox  Alias for "connectIf", "exec:testFirefoxVerbose" tasks.
            ie  Alias for "connectIf", "exec:testIeVerbose" tasks.
         check  Alias for "exec:globals", "concurrent:linters",
                "concurrent:quality", "exec:metrics" tasks.
     connectIf  Run connect if not detected
       default  Alias for "serve" task.
 fixInstrument  Custom task.
      istanbul  Alias for "instrument", "fixInstrument", "copy:sourcesJson",
                "mochaTest:coverage", "storeCoverage", "makeReport", "coverage"
                tasks.
          make  Alias for "exec:version", "check", "jsdoc:public", "connectIf",
                "concurrent:source", "exec:buildDebug", "exec:buildRelease",
                "uglify:buildRelease", "exec:fixUglify", "concurrent:debug",
                "concurrent:release", "uglify:buildTests",
                "copy:publishVersionPlato", "copy:publishVersion",
                "copy:publishVersionDoc", "copy:publishTest" tasks.
         plato  Alias for "copy:getPlatoHistory", "exec:plato" tasks.
          node  Custom task.
       phantom  Custom task.
         rhino  Custom task.
       wscript  Custom task.
     pre-serve  Custom task.
         serve  Alias for "pre-serve", "connect:server", "watch" tasks.`

(...) The exec task also has 27 sub configurations...

As I am too lazy to remember (or even type) all the grunt tasks, I decided to create a small web interface that would
offer me all the commands I need in one click.

When you install the project and run grunt (see [readme](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#setup)),
a browser will pop to display this page:

![Welcome page](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/Welcome.png)

(...) It will be empty at first but [this will be improved](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/114).

The magic happens when you click the buttons or links.
They are simple hyperlinks to URL like: <pre>http://localhost:8000/grunt/make</pre>
This one triggers the grunt task named make.

While being executed in the background, any output generated by the task is parsed for formatting and sent back
to the browser. As a result, you can trace the task execution in real time:

![grunt make](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/make.png)

From an implementation point of view, I added a
[middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/grunt/connect-middleware/grunt.js) to the
[connect task](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect).

(...) This is not the code I am the most proud of... but it works.
I am planning to improve this code as soon as the library will offer decent parsing helpers.

## Source management

I briefly explained my issues with source management and the reason why I needed a
[template mechanism](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2016/08/my-own-templates-implementation.html).
After implementing my [own template engine](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/res/tpl.js), I
created a page that allows me to quickly enable / disable sources and reorganize them (using drag &amp; drop).

The tile titled "Sources" shows the number of active source compared to the total number of sources.
If you click it, you access the list.

![Sources preview](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/sources.png)

In front of each source, you have access to:
* **Dependencies analysis**: the red bubble shows the count of sources the current one depends on and the green bubble
shows the count of sources depending on this one. Each bubble details the dependencies inside a tooltip
* **Load checkbox**: the source will be part of the library when ticked
* **Test checkbox**: it appears only if a matching test file exists and it configures if it is included in the test
suite
* **Doc checkbox**: [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) integration appeared very late, I wanted to be able to control which
files the documentation is extracted from
* **Description**: this is directly extracted from the source by searching the
[@file](http://usejsdoc.org/tags-file.html) comment

As of today, only 28 are part of the library for a total of 100 existing sources.
Indeed, because quality is measured, I was looking for an easy way to exclude files without physically remove them from
the project.

All these files accesses are implemented through another
[middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/grunt/connect-middleware/fs.js) to the
[connect task](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect).
It implements basic [CRUD methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) on the file system.

(...) Well, Delete is not yet enabled because I didn't need it.

(...) You might also have valid concerns about security as this middleware not only allows reads but also updates.
I will add an extra path checking algorithm to make sure that only
[project files are available](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/116).
As they are backed up by git, those files can be easily restored if anything goes wrong.

As the complexity of the [sources.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commits/v0.1.5/src/sources.json) file
constantly grows, this tool rapidly demonstrated value. I recently had to re-organize the order, this was done in a
blink!

## Testing

I am constantly advocating for [Test Driven Development](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html).
As a consequence, there was no way I could release this version without the necessary tooling to achieve it.

All the available environment can be tested, this is why the tile named "Environments" was created.
But I usually go with mocha &amp; my
[bdd implementation](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2015/10/my-own-bdd-implementation.html) inside the browser.
So I created a second tile named "Tests".

![Mocha in a browser](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/mocha.png)
![BDD in a browser](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/bdd.png)

### Selenium

Manual testing in a browser is one thing but it is even better when it is fully automated.

So I implemented [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to manipulate browsers and I wrote an
[explanation to configure it](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/TESTME.md#selenium-drivers).

I had to create three helper files to deal with selenium drivers:

* [detectSelenium.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/detectSelenium.js): which is going over the
list of possible drivers (see [selenium.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/selenium.json)) and
try to instantiate each of them. As a result, a file is generated in the tmp folder and it determines what can be
used on the current host (grunt tasks will be
[dynamically generated](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/exec.js#L108-L111) from this file).

* [seleniumDriverFactory.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/seleniumDriverFactory.js): which is
responsible of initializing and configuring the driver for the selected browser

* Once the selenium tests are made browser-agnostic, the
[selenium.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/selenium.js) program executes the tests
and waits for the result.

This can be triggered through grunt tasks and it has been integrated in the build process (so that it fails if anything
goes wrong).

### Backward compatibility

Each release comes with several files:
* **gpf.js**: the minified library (see below to see how this version is built), version
[0.1.5](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.5/gpf.js)
* **gpf-debug.js**: the concatenated library (with comments), version
[0.1.5](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.5/gpf-debug.js)
* **test.js**: the minified concatenation of all test files, version
[0.1.5](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.5/tests.js)

As it is important to ensure the backward compatibility of the API, I have some
[plans](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/115) to keep track of all release
tests files in order to check them constantly.

### Developing tests

I would have some funny stories to tell about test development...

But this will be a long article so I will only give some advices learned the hard way:

* Tests are a critical part of the project. The test code must be clean and easily maintainable.
When something is broken after a modification, you will be happy if you can quickly identify the reason from the tests.

* Asynchronous testing is complex, never take any assumption on the performance of the host running your tests.
When I developed the
[timeout ones](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/test/compatibility/timeout.js),
I had some hard times understanding that the timer resolution does not allow me to consider intervals that are smaller
than 10ms. Also, I had to make sure that concurrent timeouts are triggered simultaneously.

* Testing the internal logic of the library might be necessary: the public API rely on internal helpers. This is
also true when the library supports different platforms but only one is used for code coverage (NodeJS in my case).
I decided to
[expose those internals](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/src/compatibility/timeout.js#L104-L111)
when using the source version.  A good example is the compatibility layer: NodeJS and most browsers support all the
modern API but Rhino or cscript don't. Hence, I had to develop
[tests](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/test/compatibility/timeout.js) that are capable of checking
both version (native and [polyfill](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill)).

## Code coverage

I decided to go with [istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) for
[code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage). I also evaluated [Blanket.JS](http://blanketjs.org/)
(see my [training on JavaScript functions using stubs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/training-functions-stub)) but
the first one offers more flexibility.

The code coverage is evaluated by running the tests on the source version (see build process). Some
[threshold values](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/make/metrics.json) are defined to determine if
the files satisfy the expectations regarding the minimum coverage. If not, the build process fails.

### Ignoring untested path

There are almost 41 use of
[istanbul ignore](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/v0.1.5/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md) in the sources.
For instance, the [host detection](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/src/boot.js#L160) algorithm
inside boot.js can't be fully covered because NodeJS goes only through one branch.

Each comment must be followed by an explanation of its purpose. I wrote a documentation on
[this topic](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/doc/tutorials/CODESTYLE.md#code-coverage).

To be fully transparent, I detail the coverage inside the [readme](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#metrics)
file.

### Fixing instrumentation

Most of the time, code coverage rely on source instrumentation: this step is required to add instructions in the source
code and keep track of what has been executed.

(...) [Blanket.JS](http://blanketjs.org/) does it on the fly

For [istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/), a container variable is declared at the beginning of each
modified source and this variable is referenced everywhere.

`"use strict";
var __cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA = (Function('return this'))();
if (!__cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA.__coverage__) {
    __cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA.__coverage__ = {};
}
__cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA = __cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA.__coverage__;

/* ... */

__cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA.s['1']++;
_gpfExtend(gpf, {
    clone: function (obj) {
        __cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA.f['1']++;
        __cov_wAQFT3LPP9UQX7F5lrKtpA.s['2']++;
        return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
    }
});`

If you have read the other articles (in particular the
[template mechanism one](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2016/08/my-own-templates-implementation.html)), you know that I like
doing code generation. Sometimes, I rely on a function that is converted to string, altered and converted
back to a function.

One annoying consequence of this method is that the newly created function can't use any variable declared outside of
its scope. There are some workarounds such as passing those variables to a function factory. One good example is the
[polyfill for bind](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/src/compatibility/function.js#L35-L36).

However, things get more complicated when you don't know that the created function requires variables because
it was modified by code coverage instrumentation... This one gave me some headaches...

![Need a new savior?](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/futurama-zoidsus.jpg)

Once I understood the issue, the solution became obvious: I had to make sure that those container remain available even
if the function is dynamically created. I modified the
[task](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/grunt/tasks/istanbul.js#L5-L22) to add them to the
[NodeJS global dictionary](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global).

## Quality with Plato

[Plato](https://github.com/es-analysis/plato) is probably the tool that really changed the way I develop the library.
I use it to measure the quality of the project.

Below you can see the evolution of the main criteria.

![Total/Average Lines](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/Average number of lines.png)

![Average maintainability](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/Average maintainability.png)

(...) Note that the measure taken by the 19th of February was done on all the files. Now it is done only with the files
included in the library.

On top of global metrics, a report is generated for each file, showing which functions are the most complex.
This gives you valuable hint on where you should put your efforts to make the file more maintainable.

You can check the [version 0.1.5 analysis](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/plato/index.html).

Again, I defined a
[minimum maintainability value](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/make/metrics.json) which fails
the build process if one source does not respect it.

## Documentation

A good library is a documented one. Writing documentation and making sure it is up-to-date is a painful process and the
more you can automate, the better it is.
Luckily we, JavaScript developers, can use [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) to extract relevant information from the
sources.

Documentation for version 0.1.5 can be accessed [here](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html).

### Improved automation

Did I mention I am lazy? I also hate repeating myself and I do follow the
[DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

That's why I created my own [jsdoc plugin](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/doc/gpf.js) to avoid
repetition and automate obvious information such as:
* Private accessibility when the function / member name starts with
[an underscore](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8288756/in-javascript-what-does-this-underscore-mean)
* Member types from their default value
* [Custom tags](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/doc/tutorials/CODESTYLE.md#documentation)

This plugin also allowed me to generate
[extensive documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.Error.html#.abstractMethod__anchor)
on errors based on the
[_gpfErrorDeclare instruction](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/src/error.js#L128).

An [article](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/issues/14) will come soon...

## Development process

Following [TDD](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html), I develop the tests first.
Then, I start the implementation until the test succeeds.

To help me in that task, I modified the grunt tasks
[watch](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/grunt/watch.js) and
[serve](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/grunt/tasks/serve.js)
to monitor the [src](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.1.5/src) folder.

Every modified file triggers the linters and plato.
Soon, it will also [trigger the right test](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/117).

In the mean time, I just refresh my test page in the browser.

## Build process

The library offers three flavors:
* **Source version**: this version is used for development, it
[loads all the sources files one by one](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/src/boot.js#L244-L299)
and permits the access to the internals of the library.

* **debug version**: this version is generated from the sources. It is built almost by concatenating the files after
small transformations. A first step of preprocessing deals with special comments like `/*#ifdef(DEBUG)*/`.
Then a step of [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) transformation done with
[esprima](http://esprima.org/index.html) is used to inject the sources inside the
[Universal Module Definition](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/make/UMD.js).
The resulting AST is converted back to JavaScript using [escodegen](https://github.com/estools/escodegen).
The whole processed is configured with a
[file](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/make/debug.json).

* **release version**: it uses almost the same process than the debug version but with a different
[configuration  file](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/make/release.json). Then a step of
[minification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29) is triggered.

(...) I have some ideas for performance optimization by manipulating the AST structure but this will come later.

### Google closure compiler

Initially, I was using the [Google closure compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) to minify the
release version. However, this tool takes too much liberty on the initial code
(such as changing the functions' signature) and I ended up choosing another tool.

### UglifyJS and wscript

Now I am using [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) to generate the final release version.
I opened an [issue](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/1397) because the code is not compatible with cscript but
I ended up developing my [own fix](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.1.5/make/fix_uglify.js).

## Time management

I often got the same question: "how do you find the time to work on this project?"

[GitHub](https://github.com/) provides lots of statistics regarding how much I worked over the last years...

![2013](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/2013.png)
![2014](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/2014.png)
![2015](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/2015.png)
![2016](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/2016.png)

I force myself to push at least one file or issue every day but, in the end, I don't spend lot of time.
Over the years, I found the proper balance between my personal life, my job and my projects.

![Yeah !](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/futurama-applause.jpg)

I take care of pushing each little change individually. I estimate that each change requires a maximum of 5 minutes.
Over the last year, because this is not the only project I worked on, I probably spend over 250 days on the library.

![Last year contributions](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/contributions.png)

So it means I almost did 5 pushes by day which represents an average 25 minutes of work every day (but the graph shows
that it is far from linear).

I guess the secret is "interruptibility": the ability to pause what you are doing and resume it later without losing the
focus.

## What's next

I started to plan the releases more carefully: I write stories and I document the bugs.
I also maintain a [backlog](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/4).

The next versions will focus on putting back existing code into the library, this includes:
* classes
* interfaces
* attributes
* parsing helpers

In a near future, I would like to provide sample codes in the documentation: ideally, this would be based on the tests.

More cool stuff will come soon so stay tuned!
