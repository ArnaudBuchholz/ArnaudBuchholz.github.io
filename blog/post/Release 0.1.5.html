    This new release delivers clean foundation to build the library in a proper (and faster?) way.

## It's finally out !

Almost two years ago, I was experimenting [NPM publication](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) and the
version [0.1.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js) went out.

At that time, I had no clear road map or even a vision of what I wanted to do with this library.
Long story short, I was trying to consolidate my JavaScript know-how in order to re-create (in a better way) a library
that I started in a previous company.

If you check the [package.json history](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commits/master/package.json),
version 0.1.5 'officially' started on [November 26th, 2015](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/
f117eb8ba9f0c7aaf08ce65fb3c893e2b01e322b). This was after I added some [grunt packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) to
automate linting ([jshint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) and
[ESlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-eslint)) as well as testing (mocha
[1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mocha), [2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-mocha-test)
and istanbul [1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-istanbul),
[2] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-istanbul-coverage)).

Clearly, the goal shifted from coding only to automating, testing and checking quality. And that probably explains why I
needed a full year to achieve this version.

### From Grunt command line to Web interface

As I am too lazy to remember all the grunt tasks, I decided to create a small web interface that would offer me all
the commands I need. When you install the project and run grunt
(see [readme](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js#setup)),
a browser will pop to display this page:

![Welcome page](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.5/Welcome.png)

It will be empty at first but I will [improve this part](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/114).

### Source management

### TDD

Selenium

### Quality with Plato

### Automation
