    This new release focuses on streams by offering two new tools: a way to pipe streams together (and simplify their
    use) and a CSV parser.

## New version

Just before Christmas vacations, here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/11?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.3)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Cleaning

A significant effort was put in cleaning the content of the
[publication repository](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/tree/master/gpf) as it previously
contained [one plato report folder](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/plato/index.html) as well as
[one documentation folder](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html) for each version.

Now everything is consolidated in a single folder and the plato report also includes file history (for instance:
[regexp.js](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/plato/files/src_regexp_js/index.html)).

All existing links are adjusted.

### gpf.stream.pipe

Combining streams can become tedious when more than two streams must be plugged together. This is greatly simplified
using the [gpf.stream.pipe](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.html#.pipe__anchor) helper.

It takes care of chaining the [read](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IReadableStream.html) /
[write](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IWritableStream.html) methods and returns a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that is resolved
when all the data has been processed (including
[flushable](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IFlushableStream.html) streams).

For example:

`// Reading a CSV file
var csvFile = gpf.fs.getFileStorage()
        .openTextStream("file.csv", gpf.fs.openFor.reading),
    lineAdapter = new gpf.stream.LineAdapter(),
    csvParser = new gpf.stream.csv.Parser(),
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableArray();

// csvFile -> lineAdapter -> csvParser -> output
gpf.stream.pipe(csvFile, lineAdapter, csvParser, output)
    .then(function () {
        return output.toArray();
    })
    .then(function (records) {
        // process records
    });`

### gpf.stream.csv.Parser

As demonstrated in the previous example, CSV parsing is now possible using the
[gpf.stream.csv.Parser](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.csv.Parser.html) class.

## Lessons learned

There are still some doubts regarding the mechanics of the
[gpf.stream.pipe](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.3/src/stream/pipe.js) implementation.

In particular, if an intermediate read completes before the whole stream has been processed, a new read must be
triggered. Also, error handling is unclear even if
[fully tested](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.3/test/stream/pipe.js).
Finally, flushing a stream does not necessarily means its end. Hence it should be possible to continue writing after a
flush.

As these behaviors are not yet clearly defined, **the code might require adjustments in the future**.

In any case, it demonstrates that some 'real life' examples are required to see how this could simplify (or not) the
development.

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/12) will mostly focus on:
* Finishing the release process improvements
* Introducing attributes that will be later used to simplify CSV generation
* Adding new stream helpers to filter / page batch of records

In parallel, the article on
[gpf.require.define](https://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/11/release-022-gpfrequire.html) implementation is still in progress
and some additional side projects are popping up.
