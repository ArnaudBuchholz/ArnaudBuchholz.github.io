## New version

Released right on time, here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/13?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.5)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Finalized WScript simulation

In the previous [release](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/release-024-attributes.html), Travis continuous integration
platform was [added](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/travis-integration.html).
To assess that **all hosts are working fine**, WScript had to be simulated because not supported on Linux environments.

At that time, the result was not perfect and the coverage was reaching only
[99%](https://coveralls.io/github/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js?branch=master) (including the
[documented exceptions](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COVERAGE.html)).

To achieve 100%, the environment is [tweaked to disable standard
objects](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/wscript/WScript.js#L15-L27) and let the
[compatibility layer](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html) replace them with
[polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill).

#### An unexpected test case

The simulation is based on the [sync-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-request) external library that
implements synchronous HTTP requests in NodeJS. After enabling the JSON polyfills, the tests were failing... because of
this library.

It revealed two problems:
* The JSON emulation was incomplete
* The compatiblity tests were not covering all features of the JSON object

#### Universal Module Definition

After fixing the polyfills problems (see below), the final validation consisted in running the debug and release
versions of the library inside the WScript simulator.

However, those versions are based on the concatenation of all sources with the [Universal Module
Loader](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/UMD.js).

This mechanism detects the current host and defines the gpf symbol accordingly.

When NodeJS is detected, which is the case here, the loader assigns the gpf object to the module.exports object as a
result of a [require](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_modules) call.

But in [WScript](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-LOADING.html), the library is supposed to define the
gpf symbol globally.

A workaround was implemented to simulate this behavior, it is done by [leveraging the AMD
syntax](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/7b85dca0f8af8008405b1cb6c7a82deacd9b8415)

### Improved JSON polyfill

The [JSON.parse method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse)
accepts a reviver parameter that is used to transform parsed values before the final value is returned.

The same way, the [JSON.stringify
method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) accepts two
additional parameters:
* One, named replacer, that can be either a function to transform values before the stringification process or an array
of string that serves as a whitelist of properties to be included in the final string.
* A formatting parameter, named space, that is used to beautify the output of the method.

### Improved development environment

Sources.json don't need doc=true anymore
Adds tags to identify features

GitHub tile
Refactored the code to use gpf.require.define
Documentation validation using gpf.http => Detected issue with https

Sources redesigned to show dependencies

### Flavors

The library starts to generate interest but people complain about the fact that it handles too many hosts.
Hence the idea of being able to build smaller version by picking only what could be built in

### Mapping stream

[Previous release](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/12/release-023-streams-and-pipes.html) introduced
[gpf.stream.pipe](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.html#.pipe__anchor) to chain streams together.

This release delivers a filtering processor that forwards or blocks data based on a filtering function.
Here is a modified version of the previous release's sample that includes filtering:

`// Reading a CSV file and keep only some records
/*global Record*/
var csvFile = gpf.fs.getFileStorage()
        .openTextStream("file.csv", gpf.fs.openFor.reading),
    lineAdapter = new gpf.stream.LineAdapter(),
    csvParser = new gpf.stream.csv.Parser(),
    filter = new gpf.stream.Filter(function (record) {
        return record.FIELD === "expected value";
    }),
    map = new gpf.stream.Map(function (record) {
        return new Record(record);
    })
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableArray();

// csvFile -> lineAdapter -> csvParser -> filter -> output
gpf.stream.pipe(csvFile, lineAdapter, csvParser, filter, map, output)
    .then(function () {
        return output.toArray();
    })
    .then(function (records) {
        // process records
    });`

## Lessons learned

Since this is the first productive use of the gpf.require.define, it appears to be really helpful to build the new tiles of the dashboard.

## Next release

The library becoming more complex (and bigger), it might evolve to propose several 'flavors'.
The goal would be to provide smaller / dedicated versions that cut in the feature set.

For instance, a modern browser version could see the file system management removed as well as the compatibility layer.

Today, the [dependencies.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/build/dependencies.json)  file
enumerates module dependencies. To be able to isolate them, a more accurate view is required and some modifications must
be done inside the [sources.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/sources.json) file.

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/13) will mostly focus on:
* Documenting attributes
* Refining the WScript simulation
* Improving the development framework (illustrate the versions)
* Adding a new stream helper to transform records
