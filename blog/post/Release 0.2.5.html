## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/13?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.5)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Finalized WScript simulation

In the previous [release](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/release-024-attributes.html), Travis continuous integration
platform was [integrated](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/travis-integration.html).
To assess that **all hosts are working fine**, WScript had to be **simulated** because not supported on Linux
environments.

At that time, **the result was not perfect** and the coverage was reaching only
[99%](https://coveralls.io/github/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js?branch=master) (including the
[documented exceptions](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COVERAGE.html)).

To achieve 100%, the environment is now **[tweaked to disable standard
objects](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/wscript/WScript.js#L15-L27)** and let the
[compatibility layer](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html) replace them with
[polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill).

#### An unexpected test case

The simulation is based on the [sync-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-request) external library that
implements **synchronous HTTP requests in NodeJS**. After enabling the JSON polyfills, **the tests were failing**...
because of this library.

It revealed two problems:
* The **JSON emulation was incomplete**
* The **compatibility tests** were not covering all features of the JSON object

#### Universal Module Definition

After fixing the polyfills problems (see below), the final validation consisted in **running the debug and release
versions** of the library inside the WScript simulator.

However, those versions are based on the concatenation of all sources with the [Universal Module
Loader](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/UMD.js).

This mechanism **detects the current host** and defines the gpf symbol accordingly.

When NodeJS is detected, which is the case here, the loader assigns the gpf namespace to
[module.exports](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/)  to
be the result of a [require](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_modules) call.

But in WScript, the library is **supposed to define the gpf symbol
[globally](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-LOADING.html)**.

A **workaround was implemented** to simulate this behavior, it is done by [leveraging the AMD
syntax](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/7b85dca0f8af8008405b1cb6c7a82deacd9b8415).

### Improved JSON polyfill

The [JSON.parse method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse)
accepts a reviver parameter that is used to **transform parsed values** before the final value is returned.

[New tests](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/test/compatibility/json.js#L209-L233) were added and
the missing part was implemented.

The same way, the [JSON.stringify
method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) accepts two
additional parameters:
* One, documented as replacer, that can be either a function to **transform values before the stringification process**
or an array of string that serves as a **whitelist of properties** to be included in the final string.
* A formatting parameter, documented as space, that is used to **beautify the output** of the method.

[New tests](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/test/compatibility/json.js#L121-L184) were added and
the missing parts were implemented.

### Improved development environment

In this release, a **significant effort** was put in the development environment.

#### sources.json

The [sources.json file](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/src/sources.json) is the **spinal column**
of the library. It defines **which sources are loaded** and **additional properties** can be associated to them.

For instance, the "test" attribute defines when the associated test file (same name but under
[test](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/test) instead of
[src](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/src)) should be loaded. The default value
being true, only the sources with no test file are flagged with false
(for [example](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/sources.json#L12)).

The sources list was **[recently](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/release-024-attributes.html) cleaned up** for
[DeepScan](https://deepscan.io/dashboard#view=project&pid=1923&bid=8681). As a result, the remaining sources were all
containing documentation to extract. Consequently, the **"doc" attribute has been removed**.

Also, **a space separated list of tags** was added, where:
* **core** means the source is a core feature and it must always be loaded
* **host:hostname** means the source is specific to the host hostname
* any other tag is interpreted as a **feature name** (for instance: define, require, fs...)

This is used for the flavors development that will be detailed right after.

#### GitHub tile

A new tile was added to the development dashboard.

![The GitHub tile](http://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.5/GitHub%20tile.png)

It connects to the [GitHub API](https://github.com/) to **fetch the current release progress** and **links directly**
to it.

This was also the opportunity to **redesign the whole dashboard**.
All the **HTML is now generated** and [modules](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.5/res/tiles)
are organized thanks to the
[gpf.require.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.require.html#.define__anchor) feature.

#### Documentation validation

The only way to make sure that all links contained in the documentation are actually pointing to something is to try
them. A new step in the build process was added to
**[validate](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/doc/validate.js) the documentation by checking all
the links**.

Here again, it was a nice opportunity to test the [gpf.http](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.http.html)
feature.

#### Dependency viewer

The sources page was redesigned to **visually show dependencies**. It was done thanks to the awesome
[dependency wheel](https://github.com/fzaninotto/DependencyWheel) from Francois Zaninotto.

#### Simplified release

Last but not least, the library is now completely released through a **single command line**.

### Flavors

The library starts to **generate interest** but people often complain about the fact that it handles too many hosts and,
consequently, **it's too big**.

Furthermore, some internal mechanics generate troubles:
* The use of
[ActiveXObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/activexobject-object-javascript)
may generate security issues on Internet Explorer
* require("js") produces extra work with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* ...

Hence, some time was invested to study the ability to build **smaller - more dedicated - versions** by having a way to
specify **which parts to consolidate** in the library.

The idea is to rely on feature tags.

For instance, if one wants to use [require](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-REQUIRE.html) on
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) only, the flavor would be "require host:nodejs".
From there, an [algorithm](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/make/flavor.js) is capable of
**listing all the sources that must be included** by:
* filtering sources from tags
* adding selected sources' dependencies

### Mapping stream

This release delivers a [mapping stream](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.Map.html) that completes
the [filtering stream](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.Filter.html) introduced in the last version.

Here is a modified version of the previous release's sample that includes mapping:

`// Reading a CSV file and keep only some records
/*global Record*/
var csvFile = gpf.fs.getFileStorage()
        .openTextStream("file.csv", gpf.fs.openFor.reading),
    lineAdapter = new gpf.stream.LineAdapter(),
    csvParser = new gpf.stream.csv.Parser(),
    filter = new gpf.stream.Filter(function (record) {
        return record.FIELD === "expected value";
    }),
    map = new gpf.stream.Map(function (record) {
        return new Record(record);
    })
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableArray();

// csvFile -> lineAdapter -> csvParser -> filter -> map -> output
gpf.stream.pipe(csvFile, lineAdapter, csvParser, filter, map, output)
    .then(function () {
        return output.toArray();
    })
    .then(function (records) {
        // process records
    });`

See how you can **easily swap the streams to refactor the code**:
let say that the Record class has a method named isObsolete which gives the filtering condition.
You don't need to rely on the CSV literal object properties to reproduce the logic:

`// Reading a CSV file and keep only some records
/*global Record*/
var csvFile = gpf.fs.getFileStorage()
        .openTextStream("file.csv", gpf.fs.openFor.reading),
    lineAdapter = new gpf.stream.LineAdapter(),
    csvParser = new gpf.stream.csv.Parser(),
    filter = new gpf.stream.Filter(function (record) {
        return !record.isObsolete();
    }),
    map = new gpf.stream.Map(function (record) {
        return new Record(record);
    })
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableArray();

// csvFile -> lineAdapter -> csvParser -> map -> filter -> output
gpf.stream.pipe(csvFile, lineAdapter, csvParser, map, filter, output)
    .then(function () {
        return output.toArray();
    })
    .then(function (records) {
        // process records
    });`


## Lessons learned

This release enabled a 'real' **productive use of the library**. And, naturally, several weaknesses were identified.

For instance, requests to HTTPS websites were [not working](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/246) with
NodeJS.

The same way, the usability of the
[gpf.require.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.require.html#.define__anchor) feature has to be
improved **whenever something goes wrong**.

If loading fails because the resource file does not exist or its evaluation generates an error, the resulting exception
must help the developer to quickly find and fix the problem:
* **Which** resource is concerned?
* Through which **intermediate** resources it was loaded?
* **What** is the problem?
* **Where** is the problem (line number)?

Also, debugging loaded module might become a challenge since the evaluation model prevents the browser to **map the file
in the debugger**.

But, in the end, this exercise **validated the concepts**: the tiles were quickly redesigned and common code put in
modules that are shared by all of them:
* a [tile base class](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/res/tiles/tile.js)
* targeted helpers ([dom](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/res/dom.js) and
[dialogs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.5/res/dialogs.js))

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/14) will mostly focus on:
* Taking care of improving gpf.define.require
* Releasing a standalone version of the gpf.define.require feature
* Offering Object Oriented concepts (abstract classes, singletons, final classes)
* Documenting JSON compatibility
