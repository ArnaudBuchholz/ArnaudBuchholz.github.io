## New version

Released right on time, here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/13?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.5)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Finalized WScript simulation

In the previous [release](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/release-024-attributes.html), Travis continuous integration
platform was [integrated](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/travis-integration.html).
To assess that **all hosts are working fine**, WScript had to be simulated because not supported on Linux environments.

The simulation was not perfect and the coverage was reaching only
[99%](https://coveralls.io/github/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js?branch=master) (including the documented exceptions).

To reach 100%, the simulator is [tweaked to disable standard
objects](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/wscript/WScript.js#L15-L27) and let the
[compatibility layer](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html) takes care of them with
[polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill).

After fixing the JSON polyfills (see below), one problem was remaining.

When using the debug & release versions of the library, the [Universal Module
Loader](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/UMD.js) successfully detects NodeJS and it prevents
the proper loading of WScript simulation. Indeed, when using NodeJS, the result is expected to be obtained through the
module.export syntax (CommonJS link).
In WScript (link to loading the library), the library is loaded by defining the global symbol gpf.
A workaround takes care of simulating this behavior by mocking the AMD syntax
(https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/commit/7b85dca0f8af8008405b1cb6c7a82deacd9b8415)

### Improved JSON polyfill

JSON.parse with reviver parameter
JSON.stringify with replacer and space

### Improved development environment

Sources.json don't need doc=true anymore
Adds tags to identify features

GitHub tile
Refactored the code to use gpf.require.define
Documentation validation using gpf.http => Detected issue with https
Sources redesigned to show dependencies

### Flavors

The library starts to generate interest but people complain about the fact that it handles too many hosts.
Hence the idea of being able to build smaller version by picking only what could be built in

### Mapping stream

[Previous release](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/12/release-023-streams-and-pipes.html) introduced
[gpf.stream.pipe](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.html#.pipe__anchor) to chain streams together.

This release delivers a filtering processor that forwards or blocks data based on a filtering function.
Here is a modified version of the previous release's sample that includes filtering:

`// Reading a CSV file and keep only some records
/*global Record*/
var csvFile = gpf.fs.getFileStorage()
        .openTextStream("file.csv", gpf.fs.openFor.reading),
    lineAdapter = new gpf.stream.LineAdapter(),
    csvParser = new gpf.stream.csv.Parser(),
    filter = new gpf.stream.Filter(function (record) {
        return record.FIELD === "expected value";
    }),
    map = new gpf.stream.Map(function (record) {
        return new Record(record);
    })
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableArray();

// csvFile -> lineAdapter -> csvParser -> filter -> output
gpf.stream.pipe(csvFile, lineAdapter, csvParser, filter, map, output)
    .then(function () {
        return output.toArray();
    })
    .then(function (records) {
        // process records
    });`

## Lessons learned

Since this is the first productive use of the gpf.require.define, it appears to be really helpful to build the new tiles of the dashboard.

## Next release

The library becoming more complex (and bigger), it might evolve to propose several 'flavors'.
The goal would be to provide smaller / dedicated versions that cut in the feature set.

For instance, a modern browser version could see the file system management removed as well as the compatibility layer.

Today, the [dependencies.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/build/dependencies.json)  file
enumerates module dependencies. To be able to isolate them, a more accurate view is required and some modifications must
be done inside the [sources.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/sources.json) file.

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/13) will mostly focus on:
* Documenting attributes
* Refining the WScript simulation
* Improving the development framework (illustrate the versions)
* Adding a new stream helper to transform records
