    Jsdoc provides a convenient way to document APIs by adding comments to the code.
    However, the task can be really tedious when it comes to documenting every details of each symbol.
    Luckily, the tool provides ways to interact with the parsing process through the creation of plugins.

## Introduction

Just before the release of version 0.1.5, I started to focus on documentation.
I knew I had to use [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) but I started experimenting very late.

I soon realized that I had to do lot of copy & paste...
The lazy developer in me started to get annoyed and I started to look at ways I could do things more efficiently.

The official jsdoc documentation page about plugin is quite short...
Lack of documentation

## Member types

    When creating a class, I use to declare members and initialize them with a default value
    Most of the time the value type can be deduced from this default value

## Access type

### Naming convetion

    By default, all symbols are public.
    I follow the naming convention where the underscore at the beginning of the member names means that the member
    is private.

### Class definitions

    In the next versions, I will implement a class definition method and the structure will provide information about
    member visibility. The idea would be to avoid writing @private / @protected
    Will also handle @static

## Custom tags

chainable
    Same return type
    Simple description

read / write
    Defining property getters and setters

sameas
    Revealing pattern / DRY principle applied to comments

## The enumeration case

    What's the point of showing the value of an enum?
    I removed it.

## The error classes example

    That one is the most interesting example I had to go through

### Error generation in GPF-JS

    Explain that everything starts from _gpfErrorDeclare
Example:

    One method is created
    One class is created

### Documentation generation

    Two steps process

    1. Creating new documentation blocks during the beforeParse

    2. Blocking the default handling through the node visitor


## ESLint customization

valid-jsdoc.js
    return handling (
    parameter handling (signature defined)

## Conclusion

The lazy developper in me is statisfied :-)
