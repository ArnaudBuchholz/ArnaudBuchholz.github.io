## Release content

### Bug fixes

I already mentionned in the last releases that I was working on a side project. It's been a while.
This development revealed many problems in the library that were addressed in different releases (such as the [support
of ES6](http://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2019/03/release-029-es6-support.html)).

Because the pressure got high, the focus completely shifted to this project on the last months and several little bugs
were fixed during that time.

Now that the project is ready for production, an 'official' release of thoses bug fixes is required.

But, in the end, it also validates the use of the library in a productive environment.

### Improved documentation

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/19) *may be* about performances.

Several other projects require my attention, the library might be put on the back burner for a while.
