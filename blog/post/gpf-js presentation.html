## Happy New Year 2016 !
![2015 was already the future, welcome to 2016 !](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/
oct21-2015.jpg)

First of all, I'd like to wish you an happy new year 2016 ! May your lives, studies, careers, projects and everything
that makes sense to you be successful.

This is a good time to look back and comment on what happened in order to take new resolutions for the coming year.
Talking about me, I would like to present you a project that I have been working on for the last 2 years and that was
greatly improved over the last months.

![GPF-JS GitHub contributions](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/contributions.png)

## First, let's set the context
This is a pretty long story but I will try to make it short for the sake of your network bandwidth.

### Work experience

If you look into [my profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/arnaudbuchholz), you will read that my longest experience was
in a French company as a software engineer and this is where I learnt most of what I know today regarding coding.
In the beginning *(i.e. 15 years ago)*, we were using JavaScript as a middleware language to glue C/C++ components
together. Because I was surrounded by skilled people, advanced notions like prototype inheritance and code generation
were known and wisely used.

Moving to the cloud, the company created an ASP.NET web application and scripting was used to implement small behaviors
as the HTML was generated on server side.

But in the last years, I witnessed the growing importance of JavaScript as it was used both on Back-End and Front-End.

### Personal experience

I would not pretend I had a natural preference for this language: I have also coded in C, C++, Pascal (... remember
Delphi?), VBA (yuck!), C# and a little bit of Java...

However, I quickly identified three main advantages of the JavaScript language over the other ones:
* No specific IDE or compilation is needed: use notepad to edit the source and run the file. There is no better way to
quickly develop... and this is what I did for a very long time.

* [Windows Script Host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Script_Host). Indeed, this host lets you instantiate COM
component (using new ActiveXObject) and, from there, you could then access critical Windows features
([file system](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6tkce7xa.aspx),
[registry](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x05fawxd.aspx),
[http](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384106.aspx),
[wmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation) ...)

* Compatibility: within browsers, JavaScript is available almost everywhere. I will discover later that
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) also provides compatibility through command lines.

I decided to invest my personal time learning more about the language.

![You want me to buy a subscription to the 'JavaScript Journal'?](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/

Because I am a [lazy developer](http://threevirtues.com/), I created a series of command line tools (using cscript) to
automate some of my tasks. This later became a unified toolkit that was adopted by several teams to help them in
their daily job.

Also, as I am curious and my son likes Pokemon, I started to create a
[card game simulator](http://buchholz.free.fr/PokeMul/).

From the tools I obtained a collection of JavaScript helpers (consolidated in a library), a good understanding of the
language basics and a nice sense of debugging with printouts. On the other hand, the game helped me to experiment object
oriented programming with JavaScript and all the troubles (...I mean fun stuff...) related to web development.

So far, I had not been exposed to any framework: I started with jQuery on the game development but I quickly realized
I was using only the query selector API. I have to say that it has been a chance: I forced myself to learn all the
basics of web development with [vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/).

### Canadian experience

Then, I had to quit my job to move to Canada.

![It's cold out there](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/20130403-234545.jpg)

As I have been quite successful with my card game simulator, I found a job as a web developer in a startup.
This is where I discovered [ExtJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and its
[build process](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/). I also got familiar with NodeJS by creating tools
to analyzes the code or to mock the server.

Later I moved to another company that was relying on AngularJS. Quickly, I became fluent with the framework and the
tooling associated to the web development (such as grunt).

### The idea

From these experiences, I learned a lot. I have also been frustrated because I knew I was only scratching the surface
of something bigger. When you look at the number of frameworks that exist now, you realize how much the JavaScript
language is versatile and powerful. During my experimentations, I had some ideas I wanted to put in action in order to
see if they would really be helpful or valuable.

![The idea](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/docs idea.jpg)

Basically, my flux capacitor is composed of:
* A unified class definition formalism ([gpf.define](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
e6982dd33568f9d2a6fc6d9ee919ab0fae96bfa9/test/define.js#L16-L28))
* Attributes to configure / alter those classes in a declarative way ([gpf.attributes.Attribute](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/e6982dd33568f9d2a6fc6d9ee919ab0fae96bfa9/test/attributes.js#L15-L36))
* Interfaces ([gpf.interfaces.Interface](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
e6982dd33568f9d2a6fc6d9ee919ab0fae96bfa9/test/interfaces.js#L52-L81))

So I started to develop a library (not a framework, reasons detailed below) that would help me implement these.

Because it is my own project, I also wanted to come through the following challenges:
* [Interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_portability) with different hosts (NodeJS, browser, cscript
and later Rhino...) and versions of JavaScript (through [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill))
* A custom [minification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) process
* A controllable source system
* [TDD, TDD, TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

## Building a library

### Framework vs library

First of all, I would like to clarify my vision of the difference between a framework and a library.

(...) Please note that it is a personal interpretation based on my experience. Don't read it as a universal definition
to all existing frameworks or libraries.

On one hand, a framework is designed to simplify complex tasks with the objective of building a given result (such as
a single page application). Usually, it helps you building something faster but at the cost of forcing the developer to
understand and apply the specific logic of it. As soon as you want to escape from the rigid structure, this are getting
ugly. This last sentence is obviously moderated by the capacity of the framework to accepts these changes (some simply
don't). In that sense, ExtJS and AngularJS are frameworks.

On the other hand, a library solves a problem with a narrowed scope: it doesn't try to solve everything. In that sense,
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) are libraries.

Looking at what I want to achieve, I am trying to create helpers to simplify the JavaScript developments in general.

### Organizing sources

The very first library I created in JavaScript was a big mess (script.lib.js, for those who still use it... sorry):

* Everything was written in a single - huge - file
* I had no clue about the minification process so I named my variables with single letters and a comment to know what
they were used for. A simple script was stripping the comments to generate the 'release' build:

`function capitalize(s/*string*/) {
    return s/*string*/[0].toUpperCase() + s/*string*/.substr(1);
}
`

* I had no clear understanding of private scoping so everything was created globally (and easily 'hackable')

I learned by making mistakes but I came up with a better organization:

* Features are grouped by modules, a module is a single JavaScript source file (for instance:
[error](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/error.js))
* The list of modules is consolidated in a unique [source file](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/
src/sources.js)
* Each module may import and export 'internals': the linters global & exported are leveraged to consolidate a list of
globals and update the documentation within each module (this is done with [make/globals.js](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/globals.js))
