            I have been developping this library for more than 3 years and I recently realized that I never took the
            time to explain the reasons why I started this whole thing and what I am trying to achieve here.
            Welcome to my utopia where a perfectionnist is trying to re-invent the wheel.

## First, let's set the context
This is a pretty long story but I will try to make it short for the sake of your network bandwidth.

### Work experience

If you look into my profile, you will read that my biggest experience was in a French software company and this is
where I learnt most of what I know today regarding software craftmanship. Being curious by nature, I even tried to
leave the development to be more customer-centric and I have been a trainer as well as a technical support.

At that time, they were using JavaScript as a middleware language to glue components together
    Then they started to do web development

I was not aware of the SPA notion but I decided I would learn more about JS and that's why I started to code
    different projects in JS (pokemul)...



My flux capacitor is composed of:
* A unified class definition system (gpf.define)
* Attributes to declaratively configure / alter those classes (gpf.attributes.Attribute)
* Interfaces (gpf.interfaces.Interface)

## Building a library

    Organizing sources,
    Minification & build process

## Javascript Development (with a capital D)

### Linters

### Grunt

## Test Driven Development

    BDD
    Mocha

## Code coverage

    Istanbul

## Code analysis

    Plato

## GitHub
