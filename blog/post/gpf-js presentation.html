            I have been developing this library for more than 3 years and I recently realized that I never took the
            time to explain the reasons why I started this whole thing and what I am trying to achieve here.
            Welcome to my utopia where a perfectionist is trying to re-invent the wheel.

## First, let's set the context
This is a pretty long story but I will try to make it short for the sake of your network bandwidth.

### Work experience

If you look into [my profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/arnaudbuchholz), you will read that my longest experience was
in a French software company and this is where I learnt most of what I know today regarding
[software craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship).
At that time, we were using JavaScript as a middleware language to glue COM components together.
Moving to the cloud, the company started web development with ASP.NET and the JavaScript was used only to code small
behaviors as the HTML was generated on server side.

I was not yet aware of the SPA notion but I felt we were just scratching the surface of something bigger.
I decided to invest my personal time learning more about the language.

This is how I started to code different projects:

* I created a series of command lines tools (using Microsoft cscript) to automate some of my tasks. This later became a
unified tool that was adopted by the support & consulting teams to do their daily job
* I worked on a card game simulator for my son (PokeMul)

From the first I obtained a collection of helpers and a good sense of debugging with print outs.
The second taught me object oriented programming and all the troubles related to web development.

I have not yet been exposed to any framework but I used jQuery in the web development.

Then, I had to quit my job because my family moved to Canada.
As I have been quite successful with my card game simulator, I found a job as a web developer in a startup.
This is where I discovered ExtJS and its build process.
Later I moved to another company that was investing on AngularJS.
Now I am working in a **big** one...

These experiences allowed me to discover the tooling associated to the language: I also familiarized myself with NodeJS.

### The idea

![The idea](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/docs idea.jpg)

My flux capacitor is composed of:
* A unified class definition system (gpf.define)
* Attributes to configure / alter those classes in a declarative way (gpf.attributes.Attribute)
* Interfaces (gpf.interfaces.Interface)

The other challenges I wanted to come through:
* Inter-operability with different hosts (NodeJS, browser, cscript and later Rhino...)
* A custom minification process
* A controllable source system
* TDD, TDD, TDD
