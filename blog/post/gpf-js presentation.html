## Happy New Year 2016 !
!/[2015 was already the future, imagine what will happen in 2016 !](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/
gpf-js presentation/oct21-2015.jpg)

First of all, I'd like to wish you an happy new year 2016 ! May your lives, studies, careers, projects and everything
that makes sense to you be successful.

This is a good time to look back and ponder on what happened in order to take new resolutions for the coming year.
Talking about me, I would like to present you a personal project that I have been working on for the last 2 years and
that was greatly improved over the last months.

!/[GPF-JS GitHub contributions](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/contributions.png)

## First, let's set the context
This is a pretty long story but I will try to make it short for the sake of your network bandwidth.

### Work experience with JavaScript

If you look into [my profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/arnaudbuchholz), you will read that my longest experience was
in a French company as a software engineer and this is where I learnt most of what I know today regarding coding.
In the beginning *(i.e. 15 years ago)*, we were using JavaScript as a middleware language to glue C/C++ components
together. Because I was surrounded by skilled people, advanced notions like prototype inheritance and code generation
were known and wisely used.

Moving to the cloud, the company created an ASP.NET web application and scripting was used to implement small behaviors
as the HTML was generated on server side.

But in the last years, I witnessed the growing importance of JavaScript as it was used both on Back-End and Front-End.

### Personal experience with JavaScript

I would not pretend I had a natural preference for this language: I have also coded in C, C++, Pascal (... remember
Delphi?), VBA (yuck!), C# and a little bit of Java...

However, I quickly identified three main advantages of the JavaScript language over the other ones:
* No specific IDE or compilation is needed: use notepad to edit the source and run the file. There is no better way to
quickly develop... and this is what I did for a very long time.

* [Windows Script Host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Script_Host). Indeed, this host lets you instantiate COM
component (using new ActiveXObject) and, from there, you could then access critical Windows features
([file system](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6tkce7xa.aspx),
[registry](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x05fawxd.aspx),
[http](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384106.aspx),
[wmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation) ...)

* Compatibility: within browsers, JavaScript is available almost everywhere. I will discover later that
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) also provides compatibility through command lines.

I decided to invest my personal time learning more about the language.

gpf-js presentation/docbrownb61406.jpg)

Because I am a [lazy developer](http://threevirtues.com/), I created a series of command line tools (using cscript) to
automate some of my tasks. This later became a unified toolkit that was adopted by several teams to help them in
their daily job.

Also, as I am curious and my son likes Pokemon, I started to create a
[card game simulator](http://buchholz.free.fr/PokeMul/).

From the tools I obtained a collection of JavaScript helpers (consolidated in a library), a good understanding of the
language basics and a nice sense of debugging with printouts. On the other hand, the game helped me to experiment object
oriented programming with JavaScript and all the troubles (...I mean fun stuff...) related to web development.

So far, I had not been exposed to any framework: I started with jQuery on the game development but I quickly realized
I was using only the query selector API. I have to say that it has been a chance: I forced myself to learn all the
basics of web development with [vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/).

### Canadian experience with JavaScript

Then, I had to quit my job to move to Canada.

!/[It's cold out there](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/20130403-234545.jpg)

As I have been quite successful with my card game simulator, I found a job as a web developer in a startup.
This is where I discovered [ExtJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and its
[build process](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/). I also got familiar with NodeJS by creating tools
to analyzes the code or to mock the server.

Later I moved to another company that was relying on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).
Quickly, I became fluent with the framework and the tooling associated to the web development (such as
[grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)).

Now I work for a big company where I use my JavaScript expertise to build cloud solutions.

### The idea

From these experiences, I learned a lot. I have also been frustrated because I knew I was only scratching the surface
of something bigger. When you look at the number of [libraries and frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_JavaScript_libraries)  that exist now, you realize how much the JavaScript language is versatile and powerful.
During my researches, I had some ideas that I wanted to put in action in order to see if they would really be helpful
or valuable.

!/[The idea](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/docs idea.jpg)

Basically, my flux capacitor is composed of:
* A unified class definition formalism ([gpf.define](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
e6982dd33568f9d2a6fc6d9ee919ab0fae96bfa9/test/define.js#L16-L28))
* Attributes to configure / alter those classes in a declarative way ([gpf.attributes.Attribute](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/e6982dd33568f9d2a6fc6d9ee919ab0fae96bfa9/test/attributes.js#L15-L36))
* A unified [event handling](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/events.js) mechanism (callbacks
or [promises](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/28191a4bebb294fd2a244f0974402a434b554245/test/
events.js#L358-L390))
* Interfaces ([gpf.interfaces.Interface](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
e6982dd33568f9d2a6fc6d9ee919ab0fae96bfa9/test/interfaces.js#L52-L81)): in particular the
[stream ones](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/interfaces/stream.js).

So I started to develop a library (not a framework, reasons detailed below) that would help me implement these.

Because it is my own project, I also wanted to come through the following challenges:
* A real source repository ([GitHub](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/))
* [Interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_portability) with different hosts (NodeJS, browser, cscript
and later Rhino...) and versions of JavaScript (through [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill))
* A custom [minification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming) process to experiment optimizations
* [TDD, TDD, TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

## Building a library

### Framework vs library

First of all, I would like to clarify my vision of the difference between a framework and a library.

(...) Please note that it is a personal interpretation based on my experience. Don't read it as a universal definition
to all existing frameworks or libraries.

On one hand, a framework is designed to simplify complex tasks with the objective of building a given result (such as
a single page application). Usually, it helps you building something faster but at the cost of forcing the developer to
understand and apply its specific logic. As soon as you want to escape from the expected structure, things are
getting ugly. This last sentence is obviously moderated by the capacity of the framework to accepts these changes but
some simply don'). In that sense, [ExtJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) are frameworks.

On the other hand, a library solves a problem with a narrowed scope: it doesn't try to do everything.
In that sense, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) are libraries.

Looking at what I want to achieve, I am trying to create a collection of helpers to simplify the JavaScript development
in general.

### Organizing sources

!/[Let's rock !](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/gpf-js presentation/Amplifier.jpg)

The very first library I created in JavaScript was a big mess (script.lib.js, for those who still use it... sorry):

* Everything was written in a single - huge - file... maintained on my drive (versioning was done by zipping the file
and renaming it manually)
* I had no clue about the minification tools so I named my variables with single letters and a comment to know what
they were used for (the worst thing to do). Then, a simple command line was stripping the comments as well as the
unnecessary formatting characters to generate the 'release' build.

For instance, I wrote:
`function capitalize(s/*string*/) {
    return s/*string*/[0].toUpperCase() + s/*string*/.substr(1);
}
`

To generate:
`function capitalize(s) {return s[0].toUpperCase()+s.substr(1);}`

    * I had no clear understanding of private scoping so everything was created globally (and easily 'hackable')

I learned by making mistakes and, after several attempts, I came up with a better organization:

* Features are grouped by modules, a module is a single JavaScript source file (for instance:
[error](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/error.js))
* Modules are not using any private context (using classical [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Immediately-invoked_function_expression)), this is injected afterward by the build process (see next part)
* Each module may import and export 'internals': the [linters global & exported keywords](https://github.com/
ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/3f950527beb10ef44e999da391d71a61d0f76f0e/src/error.js#L3-L6) are leveraged to consolidate
(and check) the list of dependencies and update the documentation within each module (this is done with
[make/globals.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/globals.js))
* The list of modules is consolidated in a unique [source file](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/
src/sources.js): a [marker](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/
3f950527beb10ef44e999da391d71a61d0f76f0e/src/sources.js#L42) decides which modules are in the library.

I even wrote a [coding guideline](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/CODESTYLE.md) !

### Minification & build process

When you develop a library, you must think about its publication (or at least the way you want to use it):
ideally, you produce a single file that has been minified (to reduce its size) and possibly obfuscated (you may want to
protect some of your code).

(...) A quick note about obfuscation: it is impossible to fully obfuscate the JavaScript code.
At least, you can make it really hard to read for someone who wants to reverse engineer it but, in the end, the browser
needs a valid JavaScript source to run it.

Once the sources are organized, a workflow must be set up to concatenate them and generate the result.

Here again, I made several mistakes regarding the build process:

* I did not automate this process from the beginning... this was addressed later using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
(I will come to that later)
* I had troubles with the first results: how do you validate that the generated file works as expected? I had to build
a complete test database (TDD!)
* I wanted to experiment conditional building (#ifdef) & optimizations (inlines)
* Initially, I wanted to do the minification by myself... but how do you parse JavaScript? I first tried to parse it
manually. Indeed, I have a working tokenizer (that I use for syntax highlighting) but the
[JavaScript grammar](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs/blob/master/examples/javascript.pegjs) is complex. That's why I
now rely on AST generation done by [esprima](http://esprima.org/index.html). I manipulate the structure and I rewrite
the code using [escodegen](https://github.com/estools/escodegen). However, the list of transformations to apply in order
to reach a good ratio is huge... for a very small benefit if you think that some tools already exist.
So I integrated the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) to compress the release
version.

In end, the library comes in three flavors:
* The **source** version: done by loading the [boot.js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/boot.js)
module
* The **[debug](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/build/gpf-debug.js)** version: the non-minified
concatenated-like version
* The **[release](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/build/gpf.js)** version: the minified & optimized
concatenated-like version

UMD ?

## Javascript Development (with a capital D)

### Linters

A linter is a tool that almost validate the code while you are typing it: it is capable of identifying usual mistakes
(undeclared or unused variables, missing semi-column characters...) and it is configurable (to fit your preferences).

I started with JSHint

Then I moved to ESLint as it offers more customization option and also provides custom rules mechanism based on AST
parsing

### Grunt

    Automation


    Grunt vs Gulp


### Test Driven Development

    BDD

    Mocha

    Jasmine

    qUnit

    My Own BDD implementation

### Code coverage

    Once the code is tested, how do you make sure that every line of code is actually tested? On the contrary, are sure
    that every line of code you wrote makes sense? The only way to know is to use tools that measure the code coverage.

    Istanbul with a hack for generated functions (interesting part)

### Code analysis

    How do you quantify the quality of your code? using code coverage or making sure that your linters do not generate
    any error? Is it really enough?

    Plato is a tool that go over your library and computes intersting stats such as the maintanability factor or the
    bugs ratio.

### GitHub

    Do I have to present GitHub?

## Lessons learnt


Clean code & clean coder lessons
    [software craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship).

Time management (personal time & GitHub)

I remember a comic strip I read a long time ago with this cartoonist being asked what he did to learn drawing (and
being like accused of having a gift). His answer was really funny as he just said that it was a matter of practicing and
working. Actually, this is the same for any kind of activity.

"C'est en forgeant que l'on devient forgeron" with the best translation I found being "You have to do your craft".

This is so true.
