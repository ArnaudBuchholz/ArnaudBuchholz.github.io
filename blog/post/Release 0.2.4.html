    This release increases quality, it provides a new streaming tool and it introduces attributes.
    Last but not least, a new scriping host was added to the supported list: Nashorn.

## New version

Released right on time, here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/12?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.4)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Leftovers on gpf.require.define

When writing the article
[My own require implementation](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/01/my-own-require-implementation.html),
the handling of JavaScript modules was split in two distinct parts:
* [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) handling *(mostly because of synchronous requires)*

* [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) / GPF handling *(because asynchronous)*


Furthermore, 'simple' CommonJS modules (i.e. no require with just exports) were not supported.

Those problems were addressed by fixing the issue [#219](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/219).

### Quality focus

A significant effort was put in quality:
* [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), a continuous integration platform, is enabled
* This leaded to Linux testing and [WScript simulation](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/test/host/
wscript) for non-Windows environments
* A [code coverage report](https://coveralls.io/github/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js?branch=master) is updated on each build
* A [code quality tool](https://deepscan.io/dashboard/#view=project&pid=1923&bid=8681) is monitoring the sources
* Project dependencies are [verified](https://david-dm.org/)

This is all explained in the article [Travis integration](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/03/travis-integration.html).

### Nashorn support

[Nashorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashorn_%28JavaScript_engine%29) is another JavaScript engine implemented in
Java. It's like [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino)'s little brother: it's faster
and delivered with [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

This new Java host made me realize that the [gpf.rhino](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.rhino.html)
namespace was badly named. it has been deprecated it to the benefit of the
[gpf.java](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.java.html) namespace.

### Filtering stream

[Previous release](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/12/release-023-streams-and-pipes.html) introduced
[gpf.stream.pipe](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.html#.pipe__anchor) to chain streams together.

This release delivers a filtering processor that forwards or blocks data based on a filtering function.
Here is a modified version of the previous release's sample that includes filtering:

`// Reading a CSV file and keep only some records
var csvFile = gpf.fs.getFileStorage()
        .openTextStream("file.csv", gpf.fs.openFor.reading),
    lineAdapter = new gpf.stream.LineAdapter(),
    csvParser = new gpf.stream.csv.Parser(),
    filter = new gpf.stream.Filter(function (record) {
        return record.FIELD === "expected value";
    }),
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableArray();

// csvFile -> lineAdapter -> csvParser -> filter -> output
gpf.stream.pipe(csvFile, lineAdapter, csvParser, filter, output)
    .then(function () {
        return output.toArray();
    })
    .then(function (records) {
        // process records
    });`

### Attributes

Back to 2016, an article to [introduce GPF-JS](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2016/01/gpf-js-presentation.html) was written
and it explains the concepts that were expected in the library: classes, interfaces and attributes.

The last pillar is introduced in this release.

It all starts by its simpler aspects:
* The [gpf.attributes.Attribute](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.Attribute.html) base class
* The possibility to specify attributes in a class definition (not yet documented but check the
[tests](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/attributes.js))
* An [API to extract attributes](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.html#.get__anchor) from a class

More features will come soon but this rewriting is very exciting as it fixes all the issues of the initial
draft *(developed in 2015)*.

### Improved development environment

It is now possible to use an authentication token to connect to the GitHub platform (previously user and password were
required). It opens the door for a new tile in the dashboard to speed up development.

This is already enabled in the release process which has also been improved to prepare the following version in its
final step.
Unfortunately, the command line failed when testing it on this release and the remaining steps were finished manually

...which demonstrates how much value automation brings in this procedure...

## Lessons learned

If it's not tested, it doesn't work.
This was confirmed with Travis integration where the tools were run for the first time on a non-Windows environment.

The build process is taking longer, for two reasons:
* There is a new host to test (Nashorn)
* The library now has 9 legacy test files

A [strategy will be decided](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/238) to reduce the number of tests
being run.

With the integration of [Deepscan.io](https://deepscan.io/), a lot of cleaning has been applied because there is no easy
way to exclude specific files from the tool (other than naming them one by one).
All the unused files were moved from src & test to the new
[lost+found](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/lost%2Bfound) folder.

## Next release

The library becoming more complex (and bigger), it might evolve to propose several 'flavors'.
The goal would be to provide smaller / dedicated versions that cut in the feature set.

For instance, a modern browser version could see the file system management removed as well as the compatibility layer.

Today, the [dependencies.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/build/dependencies.json)  file
enumerates module dependencies. To be able to isolate them, a more accurate view is required and some modifications must
be done inside the [sources.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/sources.json) file.

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/13) will mostly focus on:
* Documenting attributes
* Refining the WScript simulation
* Improving the development framework (illustrate the versions)
* Adding a new stream helper to transform records
