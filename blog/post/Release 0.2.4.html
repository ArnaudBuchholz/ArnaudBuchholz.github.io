## New version

Just before Christmas vacations, here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/12?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.4)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

## Release content

### Leftover on gpf.require.define

when writing the article
[My own require implementation](http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2018/01/my-own-require-implementation.html), I realized that
the handling of CommonJS modules could be merged with the other modules.

### Quality focus

Travis integration
Coverage (Wscript simulation)
Dependencies analysis

### Nashorn support

### Attributes

Initially, the library focused on classes and interfaces but

http://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2016/01/gpf-js-presentation.html

The last pillar is now available, in its simplest form: the class gpf.attributes.Attribute

### Filtering stream


Combining streams can become tedious when more than two streams must be plugged together. This is greatly simplified
using the [gpf.stream.pipe](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.stream.html#.pipe__anchor) helper.

It takes care of chaining the [read](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IReadableStream.html) /
[write](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IWritableStream.html) methods and returns a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that is resolved
when all the data has been processed (including
[flushable](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.interfaces.IFlushableStream.html) streams).

For example:

If you remember [last release example](https://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/12/release-023-streams-and-pipes.html)
illustrating streams, here is a modified version that includes filtering.

`// Reading a CSV file and keep only some records
var csvFile = gpf.fs.getFileStorage()
        .openTextStream("file.csv", gpf.fs.openFor.reading),
    lineAdapter = new gpf.stream.LineAdapter(),
    csvParser = new gpf.stream.csv.Parser(),
    filter = new gpf.stream.Filter(function (record) {
        return record.FIELD === "expected value";
    }),
    output = new gpf.stream.WritableArray();

// csvFile -> lineAdapter -> csvParser -> filter -> output
gpf.stream.pipe(csvFile, lineAdapter, csvParser, filter, output)
    .then(function () {
        return output.toArray();
    })
    .then(function (records) {
        // process records
    });`

### Improved development environment

GitHub authentication token for release
(video capture of release)

Release process improved to shorten development cycles

## Lessons learned

Working with non windows environment

Build process is getting longer:
* More hosts (Nashorn)
* More legacy tests

Thinking about reducing the legacy tests

lost+found folder >> Old code that need to be purged

More visual representatoin of sources:
* dependencies
* Evolution of the lib

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/12) will mostly focus on:
* Finishing the release process improvements
* Introducing attributes that will be later used to simplify CSV generation
* Adding new stream helpers to filter / page batch of records

In parallel, the article on
[gpf.require.define](https://gpf-js.blogspot.ca/2017/11/release-022-gpfrequire.html) implementation is still in progress
and some additional side projects are popping up.
