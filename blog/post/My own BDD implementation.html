    I consider myself as curious and I am always eager to understand / learn how things are working. 
    For the gpf-js library, I wanted to follow TDD practice.
    However, tools such as mocha / jasmine were not existing for cscript.
    Hence, I had to develop my own.

## What are TDD and BDD?

### Let's talk about test

TDD stands for Test Driven Development: long story short, the idea is to write tests first,
then write the code that passes the test.

The benefits are huge:

* **Efficiency**: you develop only what is needed
* **Quality**: you ensure that any modification does not break what was working before
* **Maintainability**: you don't fear to change the code as you know it is tested

According to [uncle Bob](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html), the exact steps are:

1. You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
2. You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
3. You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.

BDD is just a rewording of TDD to make it more behavior-oriented when it comes to writing the tests.
In the end, it is still TDD.

### Frameworks

There are lots of framework to implement TDD.
Each one have its own PROs and CONs in terms of:

* **Features**: testing helpers (asserts, hooks, mockups), integration with existing frameworks (such as AngularJS,
ExtJS), support of UI automation, support of asynchronous calls, support of browsers...
* **Implementation**: how much effort it takes to implement the framework, how much effort it takes to write tests
* **Performance**: how much time it takes to run the tests
 
I will not pretend I know them all but, at least, I seriously experimented the following:

* [Siesta](https://www.sencha.com/blog/introducing-siesta-a-testing-tool-for-ext-js/): the ExtJS specific testing tool
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): the JavaScript test framework
* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/): another JavaScript test framework

### Comparing to reality

OK, let's be honest: I did not start the [gpf-js](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js) library by doing TDD first
(can you believe it?).
By the time I write this article, I am catching up on a big refactoring that makes me change all of its sources
(I applied very strict JSHint validation rules which broke everything).

Having around 200 tests running, I really see the value of automated testing !

* Code is always valid: I can quickly detect issues whenever I change some code
* Writing tests is a way to validate an API: indeed, whenever I want to develop a new feature, I first write the code 
in the most elegant manner. I don't even pay attention if it is technically feasible, I first target a natural way of
using it. So, I start by writing tests.
* Tests are like documentation: have you ever checked the documentation of a big API? it is usually full of samples.
Tests provides you free, always up-to-date and valid samples.

## Writing BDD

### Basics

Whatever the code / UI you want to validate, you first have to define the tests you want to apply.
BDD syntax introduces several keywords (functions) that helps you organize your tests:

* **describe** is used to build a test suite, it takes two parameters: a label and a function.
The label is used to identify the test suite, the function has the advantage of providing a private scope
and, when executed, it should define specs.

* **it** is used to define a spec (a test), it takes two parameters: a label and a function.
The label is used to identify the spec, the function is executed to evaluate the test.
You may have several **it** in a **describe**.
The test function usually relies on methods to validate conditions, I will introduce the simplest one: assert.


(...) Sometimes, the function is not provided: the spec is considered pending

* **assert** is used to evaluate a condition, the signature of assert may depend but, at least,
you should have a boolean condition. Usually, when the boolean condition is false, the assertion fails.
This consequently fails the spec (test).

The level of granularity (details) you can grab from a spec depends on the framework you implemented.
Sometimes, you have the call stack (showing you which line of the spec failed) but you may only have a
failure notification (saying the spec did not pass the test).

That's why I advise to limit the spec content to a mimimum number of assertions.

Here is an example of a simple test file:

`/*global describe, it, assert*//*gpf:apply-jshint*/
"use strict";

describe("My first test", function () {
    it("always succeed", function () {
        assert(true);
    });
});`

And the associated output:

![First test](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My own BDD implementation/First test.png)

### Organizing the test suites

With these three functions, you can then organize your tests as you want.

* You may create one **describe** per functional module of your application.
* You may also have **describe** inside **describe**: this allows you to create a test suite tree.

(...) Something important to remember: **describe** functions are executed to define specs but **not** to evaluate
them. I can't tell for the other frameworks, but I expect the describe function to be called inside another describe,
**not** in an it function.

Here is an example of a describe in a describe with a failing spec:

`/*global describe, it, assert*//*gpf:apply-jshint*/
"use strict";

describe("My first test", function () {
    it("always succeed", function () {
        assert(true);
    });
    describe("An error example", function () {
        it("will fail", function () {
            assert(false);
        });
    });
});`

And the associated output:

![Second test](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My own BDD implementation/Second test.png)

### Setting up the contexts

Sometimes, you need context around the tests: you may need to mock some APIs by loading fake data or wrapping the
functions, you may want to setup a page...
The same way, you might need some cleanup code once your tests executed.

All the following keywords (functions) must be used in a **describe**, in any order.
They all accept a function as the only parameter.

* **before** is triggered only once before executing any content (describe, it) in the describe
* **after** is triggered only once after executing any content (describe, it) in the describe
* **beforeEach** is triggered before each it of this describe (direct or recursive)
* **afterEach** is triggered after each it of this describe (direct or recursive)

Here is an example of use:

`/*global describe, it, assert*//*gpf:apply-jshint*/
/*global before, after, beforeEach, afterEach*/

"use strict";

describe("Context handling", function () {
    var context1;
    describe("Setting the context1 only once", function () {
        var MAX_LOOPS = 10,
            numberOfLoops,
            sumOfContext1,
            idx,
            label;
        after(function () {
            // It will be executed after terminating the describe
            assert(0 !== context1);
            assert(MAX_LOOPS === numberOfLoops);
            assert(sumOfContext1 / numberOfLoops === context1);
            context1 = 0; // Clean-up: back to 0
        });
        before(function () {
            // It will be executed before starting the describe
            assert(undefined === context1); // not initialized
            assert(undefined === sumOfContext1); // not initialized
            assert(undefined === numberOfLoops); // not initialized
             // Initialization: set to a random value
            context1 = Math.floor(1 + 100 * Math.random());
            sumOfContext1 = 0;
            numberOfLoops = 0;
        });
        // loop 10 times and check that context1 always have the same value
        function testIfTheSame() {
            sumOfContext1 += context1;
            ++numberOfLoops;
            assert(sumOfContext1 / numberOfLoops === context1);
        }
        for (idx = 1; idx <= MAX_LOOPS; ++idx) {
            label = "context1 remains the same (" + idx + "/" + MAX_LOOPS + ")";
            it(label, testIfTheSame);
        }
        /* In this sub context,
         * the value of context1 will be changed for each it using beforeEach
         */
        describe("Changing context1 for each test", function () {
            var context1Backup,
                lastContext1;
            before(function () {
                // The parent describe defined context1
                assert(0 !== context1);
                // When leaving this describe, we will restore the value
                context1Backup = context1;
                // This remembers the last encountered value
                lastContext1 = -1;
            });
            after(function () {
                context1 = context1Backup; // Clean-up: restore the value
            });
            beforeEach(function () {
                var newValue = context1;
                while (newValue === context1) {
                    newValue = Math.floor(1 + 100 * Math.random());
                }
                context1 = newValue;
            });
            afterEach(function () {
                assert(lastContext1 === context1);
            });
            // loop 10 times and check that context1 changes every time
            function testIfDifferent() {
                assert(lastContext1 !== context1);
                lastContext1 = context1;
            }
            for (idx = 1; idx <= MAX_LOOPS; ++idx) {
                label = "context1 changes (" + idx + "/" + MAX_LOOPS + ")";
                it(label, testIfDifferent);
            }
        });
    });
    describe("Sibling describe lost context1", function () {
        it("context1 should not be set", function () {
            assert(0 === context1);
        });
    });
});`

![Third test](https://ArnaudBuchholz.github.io/blog/post/My own BDD implementation/Third test.png)

### Asynchronous testing

This is my favorite part and also probably the most tricky to implement.
This functionality piqued my curiosity the first time I played with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

Whenever you have to develop an asychronous spec or if setting up the context involves an asynchronous call,
how do you wait for the call to complete and how do you signal this completion to the test framework?

Depending on the framework, there are basically two ways (each framework may implement one, the other or even both of
them):

* The spec/context function returns a promise: the framework waits for the promise to be resolved (or rejected which
signals an error).
* The spec/context function accepts one parameter: if so, this parameter is a callback function used to signal the
completion. This function also accepts a parameter to signal an error (when specified).

Here is an example of use (using callbacks):

(...) To be able to test error cases and report on success, I added a third parameter to **it** in order to specify
that an error is expected. If no error occurs, the test fails: it inverts the logic.

`/*global describe, it, assert*//*gpf:apply-jshint*/

"use strict";

describe("Asynchronous tests", function () {
    describe("using callbacks", function () {
        describe("synchronously", function () {
            it("supports synchronous call to done", function (done) {
                done();
            });
            it("fails if a parameter is given to done", function (done) {
                done({
                    message: "Error sample"
                });
            }, true);
            it("fails if an exception occurs", function (done) {
                assert(false);
                done();
            }, true);
            it("fails if done is called twice", function (done) {
                done();
                done();
            }, true);
        });
        describe("asynchronous", function () {
            it("waits for call to done", function (done) {
                setTimeout(done, 100);
            });
            it("fails if done is never called", function (done) {
            }, true);
            it("fails if a parameter is given to done", function (done) {
                setTimeout(function () {
                    done({
                        message: "Error sample"
                    });
                }, 100);
            }, true);
        });
    });
});`

(...) You may notice that JSHint reports the missing call to done

And the associated output:

## Executing BDD

There are mainly three steps

* Load the test files to collect the descriptions
* Executes the tests
* Report on execution
