    I consider myself as curious and I am always eager to understand / learn how things are working. 
    For the gpf-js library, I wanted to follow TDD practice.
    However, tools such as mocha / jasmine were not existing for cscript.
    Hence, I had to develop my own.

### What are TDD and BDD?

TDD stands for Test Driven Development: the idea is to write tests first, then write the code that passes the test.
According to [uncle Bob](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html), the exact steps are:

1. You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
2. You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
3. You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.

BDD is just a renaming of TDD to make it more behavior oriented but, in the end, it is still TDD.

### Writing BDD

## Basics

describe, it, asserts

describe items are hierarchical

## Setting up the contexts

beforeEach, afterEach, before, after

## Asynchronous testing

it function with a done parameter

### Executing BDD

There are mainly three steps

* Load the test files to collect the descriptions
* Executes the tests
* Report on execution
