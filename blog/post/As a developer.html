    As a developer...

<p>As a developer, you should be proud of your laziness and I even recommend
that you maturate it.</p>

<p>If I ever have to make an interview and the recruiter asks me what my main
qualities are, I will start by explaining - eye to eye - that I am lazy guy.</p>

<p>Back to my school days, during my university years, I had this fantastic
teacher starting the very first hour of its computer science course by
explaining how the computer boom is all about - what he called -
the "couch run". <br/>
I first thought this guy was funny and his unusual theory was a way to make the
course less boring.</p>

<p>However, after few years of development, I now fully embrace the concept and
I would like to explain you why.</p>

<div class="note">Obviously, the following is the expression of my opinion and
it is undoubtedly subject to discussion. It does not necessarily reflect the
views and opinions of my current, former or future company... even it appears
that my managers are not complaining with my work...</div>

<p>First of all, a good developer is too lazy to write the same code twice.<br/>
Sorry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste"
target="_blank">Mister Tesler</a>! Copy and Paste is not a good solution to
apply the code everywhere it is needed.<br/>
On the contrary, a smart developer will angle for reusability and will always
write reusable code. So that the work is not done twice and, more important, it
is fixed only once.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when using a framework or a library, a lazy developer will first
check if it provides the service that will help him to develop the feature
faster. <br/>
After all, if somebody spent hours writing (and debugging) some packaged code,
it may already contain elements he can rely on.</p>

<p>Also, a good developer is too lazy to neglect the code quality. Indeed, bad
code means bugs. Bugs means extra work. <br/>
And extra work is the opposite of what a lazy guy is aiming for, right?<p>

<p>Code quality is a wide topic and there are many discussions about it.<br/>
In my opinion, it includes:
<ul>
    <li>Making sure the <u>code works</u>. It does what it is supposed to do the
        right way.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>Making sure the code is <u>understandable</u>.<br/>
        Did you ever face this situation?<br/>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Manager:</b> You should document your code!</li>
            <li><b>You:</b> Nah, it's OK I just finished it and it works. I
                don't have enough time in my ticket to add documentation that
                nobody will read anyway...</li>
            <br/><i>(six months later)</i><br/>
            <li><b>Manager:</b> OK, there is a bug here / we need an evolution,
                can you fix / do it please?</li>
            <li><b>You:</b> Well, I need first to check the code, I don't
                remember how it works... Man! Did I wrote that? ... Why did I do
                it this way?...</li>
        </ul><br/>
        Clearly it means documentation but not only. Some claim that a good code
        writing prevents the need for documentation. I somewhat agree.<br/>
        However, the truth is that when you have to read a bunch of code,
        a summary doesn't hurt (considering it is up-to-date).</li>
    <br/>
    <li>Making sure the code is <u>maintainable</u>. This usually requires
        experience but, from a general point of view, if you take any assumption
        when writing the code: make sure you will remember it.</li>
</ul>

<p>A complete developer also include tests in its development. Because testing
is boring and takes time, those tests must be automated.<br/>
One valuable freebie of automation is non-regression testing.</p>

<p>A good developer is too lazy to repeat himself. Something that I really find
painful is to repeat myself. Yes, speech is important and communication must be
good inside a team.
    But a drawing is worth a thousand words.
    Thatâ€™s why he writes documentation!

<p>Last but not least, a good developer do not work: he plays!</p>

easy way to do it."<br/><i>- Bill Gates</i></p>
