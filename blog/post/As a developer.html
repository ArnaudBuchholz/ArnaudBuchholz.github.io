    As a developer...

<p>As a developer, you should be proud about your laziness and I even recommend
that you maturate it.</p>

<p>If I ever have to make an interview and the recruiter asks me what my main
qualities are, I will start by explaining - eye to eye - that I am lazy guy.</p>

<p>Back to my school days, during my university years, I had this fantastic
teacher starting the very first hour of its computer science course by
explaining how the computer boom is all about - what he called -
the "couch run". <br/>
I first thought this guy was funny and his unusual theory was a way to make the
course less boring.</p>

<p>However, after few years of development, I now fully embrace the concept and
I would like to explain why.</p>

<div class="note">Obviously, the following is my opinion and is subject to
discussion. Probably my current company would not agree with that but it looks
like managers are not complaining with my work...</div>

<p>First of all, a good developer is too lazy to write the same code twice.<br/>
Sorry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste"
target="_blank">Mister Tesler</a>! Copy and Paste is not a good solution to
apply the code everywhere it is needed.<br/>
On the contrary, a good developer will angle for reusability and will always
write reusable code. <br/>
So that the work is not done twice and, more important, it will be fixed only
once.</p>

<p>The same way, when using a framework or a library, he will first check if it
provides the service that will help him to develop the feature faster. <br/>
If somebody spent hours writing (and debugging) this packaged code, it may
already contain elements you can rely on.</p>

<p>Also, a good developer is too lazy to neglect the code quality. Indeed, bad
code means bugs. Bugs means extra work. <br/>
And extra work is the opposite of what a lazy guy is aiming for, right?<br/>
Code quality is a wide topic and there are many discussions about it.<br/>
In my opinion, it includes:
<ul>
    <li>Making sure the <u>code works</u>. It does what it is supposed to do the right
        way.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>Making sure the code is <u>understandable</u>.
        Did you ever face this situation?<br/>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Manager:</b> You should document your code!</li>
            <li><b>You:</b> Nah, it's OK I just finished it and it works. I
                don't have enough time in my ticket to add documentation that
                nobody will read anyway...</li>
            <br/><i>(six months later)</i><br/>
            <li><b>Manager:</b> OK, there is a bug here / we need an evolution,
                can you fix / do it please?</li>
            <li><b>You:</b> Well, I need first to check the code, I don't
                remember how it works... Man! Did I wrote that? ... Why did I do
                it this way?...</li>
        </ul>
        It means documentation but not only. Some claim that a good code writing
        prevents the need for documentation. I somewhat agree.
        However, the truth is that when you have to read a bunch of code,
        a summary doesn't hurt (considering it is up-to-date).</li>
    <br/>
    <li>Making sure the code is <u>maintainable</u>. This usually requires
        experience but, from a general point of view, if you take any assumption
        when writing the code: make sure you will remember.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's why a lazy developer also include tests in its development. And
because testing is boring and takes time, those tests are mostly automated.<br/>
One valuable freebie of automation is non-regression testing.</p>

<p>A good developer is too lazy to repeat himself. Something that I really find
painful is to repeat myself. Yes, speech is important and communication must be
good inside a team.
    But a drawing is worth a thousand words.
    Thatâ€™s why he writes documentation!

<p>Last but not least, a good developer do not work: he plays!</p>

easy way to do it."<br/><i>- Bill Gates</i></p>
