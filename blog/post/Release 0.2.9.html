## Release content

### ES6 support

Subclassing an ES6 class

Attributes through decorators

Require preprocessor to enable decorator substitutions
Also improved configuration validation

Had to adapt $singleton & $abstract

### Improved serialization

Serialization name

Asymetric Serialization

### Improved compatibility

atob and btoa

removed compatibleName

any verb in gpf.http.request

### New flavor node



## Lessons learned

### Asymetric Serialization

Had lots of difficulties to set the principles
Ended up doing the most flexible choice

### Refactoring of classes

Base classes are now associated with a class definition
Also had to deal with anonymous classes (changed the validation)
Had to reconsider preprocessor (wanted to import decorators)

### Refactoring of tests

Regarding include path

### Improved flavor mechanism

to allow node and have part of COMPATIBILITY

### New eslint rules

no-substr

no-empty-modules

### Release notes

Difficult to find the release notes since one had to jump to github to check each Release
Now the readme points to them
For the current one, a redirection mechanism makes sure one access it when available

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/18) is about performances.
It's been a while I wanted to manipulate the release code to inline functions as much as possible and substitute loops
for performances.

Still, I need to work on the side project beacuse it **really** requires all my attention.
