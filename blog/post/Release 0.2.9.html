## Release content

### ES6 support

While working on a side project which is based on Node.js, I realized that **the library did not support ES6 classes**.
Not only the [gpf.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.define__anchor) API was not able to extend
any of them (even if it does not really make sense) but
it was also **impossible to add attributes** to a class that was not previously created with
[gpf.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.define__anchor) (which is more problematic).

After doing a quick test, a solution was drafted to detect and handle these classes the right way.
It is all explained in the article
[How I learned from a crazy idea](http://gpf-js.blogspot.com/2019/01/how-i-learned-from-crazy-idea.html).

The [$singleton and $abstract](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-DEFINE.html) syntaxes were adapted
accordingly.

(...) It is clearly **not recommended** to extend ES6 class using
[gpf.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.define__anchor).

In order to integrate attributes properly, a quick look in the **coming ES6 features** pointed out the fact that
**[decorators](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841)** are used to qualify class
members. Hence, an
[attribute decorator](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.html#.decorator__anchor) was created.

Last but not least, since decorators are not yet supported without
[transpiling](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them),
the library allows **[preprocessing](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.typedef.html#.requireOptions) of
resources** so that decorators can be subsituted with
[manual call of the decorator](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/bb6936760963f7dc4fc942da1eadeead5976b3b1/
test/require/es6/class_with_attributes.js#L45).

This was also the opportunity to **refactor** in depth the validation of the require configuration options.

### Improved serialization

The side project is **extensively using
[serialization attributes](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.attributes.Serializable.html)**.
Quickly, the need for **code simplification** became obvious.

First, it does not make sense to repeat the
[property name](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.typedef.html#.serializableProperty)
when it can be easily **deduced** from the member the attribute is assigned to.

(...) When set on a 'private' member, the result property name won't include the underscore.

Then, these attributes are used in a context where serialization is used to implement an
**[ODATA](https://www.odata.org/) service**.
Consequently, they are used to **describe** how the data should be sent back the client but also how it is
received.

For instance, an entity unique identifier must be transmitted to the client but it will never be modified by the client.

With the introduction of the
[readOnly property](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.typedef.html#.serializableProperty), it is possible
to make this distinction and have **asymetric serialization**.

But, as for names, it does not make sense to repeat something that is **already built in the class**.
Indeed, with the use [Object.defineProperty](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) - or using ES6 class getter / setter - it is possible to define the (get, set)
couple and, when not setter exists, configure read-only members.

That's why, **when the hosts supports it**, the serialization code will leverage
[Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/
Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor) recursively on
the class hierarchy to **determine if the member is read-only**.

### Improved compatibility

Browser's **base64 helpers** ([atob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/
atob) and [btoa](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/btoa)) were added to
the [compatibility](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html) layer.

The Function.prototype.compatibleName method has been **removed** since it induced an **extension of the Function
prototype**. Usually, libraries should avoid doing that because it is **against best practices**.

Because of the [mocking](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.http.html#.mock__anchor) implementation, the
[gpf.http.request](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.http.html#.request__anchor) was **limited** in terms
of which [http methods](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html) could be used.
Some hosts do not support
custom verbs (and this is **documented** in the
[compatibility page](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/tutorial-COMPATIBILITY.html)) but browsers & node supports
almost any verb. The code was modified to allow the use of **custom verbs**.

Surprisingly, the
[String method .substr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr)
is documented as *"to be avoided when possible"*.
Since it was massively used in the sources, an ESLint
[custom rule](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.eslintrules/no-substr.js) was developped and the
code reworked.

### New flavor node

A **Node.js flavor** was created and is used as the **default library** being loaded when using `require("gpf-js")`

It implements **all features** including the compatibility's atob and btoa.

## Lessons learned

### Asymetric Serialization

The user story [Asymetric serialization](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/299) required several updates
since it was pretty difficult to find the right **balance between simplicity of use and flexibility**. In the end,
this feature is really powerfull when applied with a converter function. Indeed, this is the place where one can control
if the value will be serialized or not.

### Refactoring of classes

Integrating ES6 classes was only the visible part of the challenging iceberg.
Actually, **the library was suffering from a structural defect regarding how classes were handled**.

Initially, each class was associated to a **class definition** created only when using
[gpf.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/gpf.html#.define__anchor).
This object **holds important information** such as the list of attributes.

When subclassing, the parent class definition was looked up by searching the one that matches the condition
`instanceBuilder.prototype instanceof entityDefinition.getInstanceBuilder()`
(*see [full code](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.8/src/define/build.js#L30)*)

As a result, you could have classes in the hierarchy that were invisible because not created with the library.

To solve this issue, a mechanism was put in place to **import any class as well as its hierarchy up to the root class**
(i.e. [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)).
It also means that **base classes are now associated with a class definition** during the
[startup of the library](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/define/class/standard.js).

This also imply that the library may have to deal with anonymous functions when importing a class.

It is still not possible to use gpf.define without a class name but, internally, **the library can import *any* class**.

### Refactoring of tests

Introduction of ES6 in the library had a **significant impact on how the tests are executed**.

Indeed, it is mandatory to check **if the host is really supporting the ES6 class syntax** before trying to create one.

So a new mechansim was built to:
* **detect features** (with the possibility to override them, like for nodewscript), result is transmitted in a global
  object available during the tests
* **include test files** dynamically

### Improved flavor mechanism

Writing the Node.js flavor was harder than expected. The main struggle came from the **inclusion of base64 helpers
without getting the whole compatibility layer**.
Furthermore, without the compatibility layer, the *compatibleName* function member was no more available.
This broke the code at many places. That's why it was decided to replace it with an **internal helper** to extract
the function name where needed (it points to the name property by default).

Also, a [flavor debugging page](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/make/flavor.html) was created to
**ensure that any update on the flavor algorithm would fit the expectations**.

<a name="todo">&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;&#128317;&#128315;</a>

### New eslint rules

As mentionned before, a new eslint rule was created to forbid the use of .substr:
[no-substr](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.eslintrules/no-substr.js).

The same way, another rule was create to ensures that if a module has no function, a default one is being created:
[no-empty-modules](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.eslintrules/no-empty-module.js).

This the linters are applied every time a module is modified, more custom rules might be created to solve common
problems (such as dependencies update).

### Release notes

Now that more than 14 releases exist for the library, it takes some time to access the release notes since one had to
go to the release tab of GitHub in order to find them.

It was decided to change the readme to include a link to the release notes.

Regarding the last version, since the notes are usually written once the release is out, a mechanism was built to
make any reader wait until the notes are out.

## Next release

The [next release content](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/18) is about performances.
It's been a while I wanted to manipulate the release code to inline functions as much as possible and substitute loops
for performances.

Still, I need to work on the side project beacuse it **really** requires all my attention.
