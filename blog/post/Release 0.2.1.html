## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/9?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.1)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

### NPM Publishing

Starting from this version, the library will be published as an [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) package.
It was already done in the past (version 0.1.4) but this version almost breaks everything that was defined at that time.
That's the reason why I changed the MINOR version number.

(...) I now that it is violating the normal [backward compatibility rule](http://semver.org/) but, actually, nobody was
really using it... And I didn't want to use MAJOR 1 until the library offers something significant.

An [.npmignore](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/.npmignore) file instructs NPM which files should
be included or not. The package is almost limited to the build folder.

### HTTP Requests

HTTP requests using the same API for all hosts and asynchronous through Promises.

NOTE that the promise is resolved when the server provides a response, whatever the status code.

```JavaScript
gpf.http.get(requestUrl).then(function (response) {
    if (response.status === 500) {
        return Promise.reject("Internal Error");
    }
    return process(response.responseText);
})
.catch(function (reason) {
    onError(reason);
});
```

The documentation is available [here](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/gpf.http.html#.request__anchor).

### Improved coverage

Because each host has its own implementation, it was important to be sure of the code coverage.
Before this version, coverage was based on instanbul and a mochaTest task.

After analyzing the way istanbul generates, stores and consolidates the coverage information, I found a way to
trigger instrumented code on all host (and use http request to save the collected information).

A new [task](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/v0.2.1/grunt/tasks/istanbul.js#L46-L58) consolidate all hosts
data into the global one.

## Lessons learned

### ECHO service

To be able to test the HTTP helpers, I needed a server which I could control the answers.

    More details will come in a future article.

### Some code was definitely not tested

Once coverage was applied to all the sources I discovered untested code.
This leaded to some simplifications (boot for instance) but also to new tests.

## Next release

For now the project is on pause because of vacations. I will take some time to plan the next iteration more carefully
but, still, I have to support my side project by creating a CSV reader as well as a record container.
