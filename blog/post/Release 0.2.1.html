## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/9?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.1)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.1/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

### HTTP Requests


### Improved coverage

### NPM Publishing

... and loading

## Lessons learned

### Some code was definitely not tested

###

## Next release

The [next release](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/9) will be dedicated to support my other project:
* A streamed line reader will be developed (and it may lead to a CSV reader)
* The library will be published to NPM (automatically when releasing the library)
* As stated above, the coverage will be re-designed to include other hosts

However, because of the side project, the release frequency may slow down.
