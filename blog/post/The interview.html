I have read lots of articles about JavaScript interviews: what are the tricky questions, how you should answer them,
what are the hot topics, which frameworks you should be looking at...
Last year, I was in charge a building a team of JavaScript developers to work on an AngularJS application.
I would like to share with you this experience in a fictionalized story based on real facts.

<code class="markdown">
That day, the HR specialist came to me with a good news.

<div><div>
- Arnaud, we have a new candidate: he got a score of 180% on xxxx. Would you mind having a quick review of his test
source that we can arrange an interview?
- Sure, I will look at that. But please remember that a good score does not mean a good candidate.
HR Specialist: No worries, just let me know if it's a go

In this company, any potential candidate is first assessed using a remote test. Two questions must be resolved with
a JavaScript program that the candidate must write. The questions were quite complex (it took me more time
to understand the question than to answer it) and 2 hours were given to complete the answers.
The interface is quite impressive as it records all the steps you go through: it also proposes testing tools so that
you can input your own data and evaluate your program with it.
Once achieved, the tool then executes a serie of tests to validate the answer and generates a report on the
correctness of the answers as well as the efficiency of the code.

At that time, my assumption was that when someone gets less than 160%, I would simply ignore him.
Over 160%, I was looking at the general algorithm, the clean
if he gets less than 160% we usually inore



`for (var idx = 0; idx < 10; ++idx) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        alert(idx);
    }, 1000);
}`
<input type="button" value="Run the code" onclick="runTheInterviewCode()">
<script language="JavaScript">
function runTheInterviewCode () {
    for (var idx = 0; idx < 10; ++idx) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            alert(idx);
        }, 1000);
    }
}
</script>
