I have read lots of articles about JavaScript interviews: what are the tricky questions, how you should answer them,
what are the hot topics, which frameworks you should be looking at...
Last year, I was in charge a building a team of JavaScript developers to work on an AngularJS application.
I would like to share with you this experience in a fictionalized story based on real facts.

<code class="markdown" id="TheInterview">
## The remote test

That day, the HR specialist came to me with a good news.

<dialog start="right">
- Arnaud, we have a new candidate: he got a score of 180% on [codility](https://codility.com/).
Would you mind having a quick review of his test so that we can arrange an interview?
- Sure, I will look at that. But please remember that a good score does not mean a good candidate
- No worries, just let me know if you want to meet him
</dialog>

In this company, any potential candidate was first assessed using a remote test.
To put it in a nutshell, it consists in two questions that have to be resolved with a JavaScript program.
The questions are quite complex *(it took me more time to understand them than to answer)* and two hours are
given to complete the algorithms.

The user interface is intuitive and it records all the steps. An inbuilt testing feature lets you enter some test cases
and it validates the algorithm you are writing.
Once completed, the tool then executes a predefined sequence of tests to approve the answer and it generates a report
on the correctness as well as the efficiency of the code.

At that time, my assumption was that when someone gets less than 160%, I would simply ignore him.
Over 160%, I was looking at the general algorithm and how the code was written. Then, we were organizing a remote
interview.

`for (var idx = 0; idx < 10; ++idx) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        alert(idx);
    }, 1000);
}`
<input type="button" value="Run the code" onclick="runTheInterviewCode()">
<script language="JavaScript">
function runTheInterviewCode () {
    for (var idx = 0; idx < 10; ++idx) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            alert(idx);
        }, 1000);
    }
}
