    Sometimes you need to alter the behavior of the code but you have no way to
    update the original source (either because you don't own it or because it
    will be updated soon).<br/>
    I will show you two ways to achieve that

### The context

I had the chance to work on a SAAS application where parts of the user interface
were fully customizable by (or for) the customer.

    Part of this customization
consisted in JavaScript files that could be added to include specific behaviors.
Obviously, the whole thing relied on standardized APIs so that we didn't have
to reinvent the wheel everytime.

Most of the time, those customization were the occasion to compute some
information, fetch or reformat data.
