    There are billions of projects on GitHub. From time to time, I like to open one and see how the whole thing has
    been tangled together by the developers. There is lot to learn not only from the good techniques but also from the
    mistakes.
    I thought it would be interesting to document my findings.

## Forewords

First of all, I'd like to express some clear disclaimers:

* Everything below should be considered as an external [opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion) with the
humble intention to give [constructive feedback](http://www.dummies.com/business/human-resources/employee-relations/
giving-constructive-feedback/) on the project content and structure.

* I am not pretending that I own any kind of universal truth but I have some expectations when analyzing a project.
Actually, I might be wrong and this is OK, we all
[learn from our mistakes](http://scottberkun.com/essays/44-how-to-learn-from-your-mistakes/). I invite you to provide
[feedback](mailto://arnaud.buchholz@free.fr?subject=[gpf-js.blogspot] GitHub/PowerCSS) if needed.

* Obviously, this has nothing to do with my professional activity: I studied this project on my personal time.

## The project

Today I will focus on [PowerCSS](https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss).

Long story short, the author proposes to replace static CSS files with dynamic ones maintained with JavaScript.
The advantages are multiple: full control on CSS properties, dynamism and, to some extend, compression.

I recommend this nice [video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnkMjzhxw4s) from the author.

### About the author

I don't know [Mike Mikowski](https://www.google.ca/search?q=Michael+S.+Mikowski&oq=Michael+S.+Mikowski) personally but
he seems to have lot of knowledge and experience with single page application development.
He also co-authored the book [Single Page Web Applications](https://www.manning.com/books/single-page-web-applications)
with Josh C. Powell.

His [GitHub](https://github.com/mmikowski?tab=repositories) account has lots of projects (15 owned).

Two projects have more than 100 stars:
* [spa](https://github.com/mmikowski/spa) Public resources for the book Single Page Web applications,
JavaScript end-to-end
* [urianchor](https://github.com/mmikowski/urianchor) jQuery plugin to manage the uri hash component.
Used for SinglePageWebApps.

Last but not least, he also has a [personal website](http://michaelmikowski.com/) where he shamelessly promotes himself.

### About the idea

Before digging into the project implementation, it is good to step back and analyze the idea.

The author proposes to drop CSS, LESS or other pre/post processors to the benefit of JavaScript. And to be honest, I
like the concept of being able to generate styles using JavaScript. However, it sounds like an extreme solution for
situations were static CSS files (generated or not) would fit 80% of what is needed.

I need to do some experiments to check

## Coding style

_xxx_ everywhere !

Use of labels (_SELECT_MAP0_:)
    Big functions

## Testing

can't run the test on windows env (unless I get cygwin or similar environment)

## Documentation

The README.md is quite complete, I would even say
a little bit too exhaustive: it looks like doing simple things is extremely complex. I would probably simplify it
to be more introductive and create a separate documentation page for 'advance' use.

I regret that the samples do not really illustrate the reason why JS should be preferred over static CSS.
As far as I know, you can easily switch CSS inside a web page.


## What I retain

## My advices

- Split the sources into several files (see the comments ======)
- Prefix private methods with _ to make it more explicit
- There must be a way to generate vMap...

- VERBOSE mode (method logIt)

## Conclusion


If I get any interest from the reader or even the author, I might go on with other projects.
