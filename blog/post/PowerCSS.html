    There are billions of projects on GitHub. From time to time, I like to open one and see how the whole thing has
    been tangled together by the developers. There is lot to learn not only from the good techniques but also from the
    mistakes.

## Forewords

First of all, I'd like to express some clear disclaimers:

* Everything below should be considered as an external [opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion) with the
humble intention to give [constructive feedback](http://www.dummies.com/business/human-resources/employee-relations/
giving-constructive-feedback/) on the project content and structure.

* I am not pretending that I own some kind of universal truth: I have some expectations when looking into a project.
Actually, I might be wrong and this is OK, we all
[learn from our mistakes](http://scottberkun.com/essays/44-how-to-learn-from-your-mistakes/).

* Obviously, this has nothing to do with my professional activity: I studied this project on my personal time.

## The project

Today I will focus on [PowerCSS](https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss).

Long story short, the author proposes to replace static CSS files with dynamic information maintained by JavaScript.
The advantages are multiple: full control on CSS properties, dynamism and compression.

## About the idea

I like the idea of being able to generate CSS using JavaScript. The README.md is quite complete, I would even say
a little bit too exhaustive: it looks like doing simple things is extremely complex. I would probably simplify it
to be more introductive and create a separate documentation page for 'advance' use.

I regret that the samples do not really illustrate the reason why JS should be preferred over static CSS.
As far as I know, you can easily switch CSS inside a web page.

## Coding style

_xxx_ everywhere !

Use of labels (_SELECT_MAP0_:)
    Big functions

## Testing

can't run the test on windows env (unless I get cygwin or similar environment)

## Documentation

## What I retain

## My advices

- Split the sources into several files (see the comments ======)
- Prefix private methods with _ to make it more explicit
- There must be a way to generate vMap...

- VERBOSE mode (method logIt)

## Conclusion
