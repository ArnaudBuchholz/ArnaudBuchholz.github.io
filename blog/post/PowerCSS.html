    There are billions of projects on GitHub. From time to time, I like to open one and see how the whole thing has
    been tangled together by the developers. There is lot to learn not only from the good techniques being used but
    also from the mistakes.

## Forewords

First of all, I'd like to start by writing that everything below should be considered as an external opinion with the
intention to give constructive feedback on a project. I am not pretending that I know better than anybody else.
And, obviously, this has nothing to do with my current job.

## The project

Today I will focus on [PowerCSS](https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss).

Long story short, the author proposes to replace static CSS files with dynamic information maintained by JavaScript.
The advantages are multiple: full control on CSS properties, dynamism

## About the idea

I like the idea of being able to generate CSS using JavaScript. The README.md is quite complete, I would even say
a little bit too exhaustive: it looks like doing simple things is extremely complex. I would probably simplify it
to be more introductive and create a separate documentation page for 'advance' use.

I regret that the samples do not really illustrate the reason why JS should be preferred over static CSS.
As far as I know, you can easily switch CSS inside a web page.
