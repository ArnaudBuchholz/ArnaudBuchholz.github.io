    This new release supports my side projects by implementing html generation and http request helpers.
    It also improves the coverage measurement and this is the first version to be published again as an NPM package.

## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/10?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.2)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.2/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

### Why did it take so long to get a new version?

First of all, no timeline is clearly defined for this project. I usually assign one month per release and I try to
commit to it. However, I prefer to take the necessary time to make sure that a release contains everything needed.

Actually, there are three main reasons to explain the delay of this release.

* The first one is
![vacations](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.2/vacations.jpg)

* The second reason is that I also worked on a [side project](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-timer) that dragged
a lot of my time. I will later write an article about it as it was my first HTML mobile app experience with a tough
customer... my wife.

</div>

* Last but not least, this release addresses an issue that appeared from time to time and that I never considered
seriously. Some tests were failing on a regular basis but not frequently enough to represent a real threat.
I decided to tackle this problem once for all and it brought many time-consuming challenges.

## Release content

### gpf.require

This is clearly the new feature coming with this version. It allows the developer to modularize its code by creating
separate source files that depend from each other. A separate article will be written to detail the concept (and
implementation) but, in the meantime, you may read the
[tutorial](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.2/doc/tutorial-REQUIRE.html) on how to use it.

I was thinking about creating such a mechanism for a while but I had no clue how to start.
After reading some documentation about NodeJS and now that the library is mature enough,
I have to say that it was surprisingly easy to implement.

![I did it](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.2/SANDCASTLES.png)

Some of you may object that, indeed, it already exists in NodeJS and browsers (natively or through different libraries
such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/)).

But this new mechanism brings one uniform feature to all supported platforms. And it comes with a way to alter the
require cache to simplify testing by injecting mocked dependencies.
