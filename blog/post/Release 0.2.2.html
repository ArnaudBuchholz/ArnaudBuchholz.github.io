## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/10?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.2.2)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.2.2/doc/index.html)
* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpf-js)

### Why did it take so long to get a new version?

First of all, no timeline is clearly defined for this project. I usually assign one month per release and I try to
commit to it. However, I prefer to take the necessary time to make sure that a release contains everything needed.

Actually, there are three main reasons to explain the delay of this release.

* The first one is
![vacations](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.2.2/vacations.jpg)

* The second is that I also worked on a [side project](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/bubu-timer) that dragged a lot
of time. I will later write an article about it as it was my first HTML mobile app experience with a tough customer...
my wife.

* Last but not least, this release addresses an issue that appeared from time to time and that I never considered
seriously. Indeed, some tests were failing on a regular basis but not frequently enough to represent a real threat.
I decided to tackle this issue and it brought many time-consuming challenges.
