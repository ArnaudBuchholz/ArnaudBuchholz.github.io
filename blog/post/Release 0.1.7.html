## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/6?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.1.7)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/doc/index.html)

### Improved $super keyword

When writing the article
[My own super implementation](http://gpf-js.blogspot.in/2017/02/my-own-super-implementation.html)
I found several issues that were immediately fixed.

### Better tooling

The following tools were modified:
* It is now possible to remove unused files from the sources page
* Each file modification triggers one pass of tests (it takes less than 1 second to execute). This way, I know as soon
as possible if something goes wrong
* [fs middleware](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/fs.js) is secured to
limit access to the project files only. It now supports the DELETE verb
* The [watch](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/watch.js) and
[serve](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/tasks/serve.js) tasks are monitoring the
[sources.json](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/src/sources.json) file modifications to update the
list of linted files. This way, it is no more required to restart the grunt task.

### More flavors for browser testing

Selenium was upgraded to version 3 and the
[detection](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/selenium/detect.js) has been fixed to make it
more reliable.

On top of Selenium, a
[command line execution wrapper](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/test/host/browser.js) combined
with a [caching service](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/blob/master/grunt/connect-middleware/cache.js)
(to store & grab the results) allows testing of non-automated browsers (such as Safari on Windows).
Once the tests are done, the command line is killed.

### Automated release

Releasing a version has never been so easy, a script using [github-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-api) module
to call the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) implements the following steps:
* Check version number
* Update package.json (if needed)
* Check GitHub milestones to identify the milestone details and check that all issues are closed
* Update README.md
* Grunt make
* Copy tmp/plato/report.history.* to build/ (grunt copy:releasePlatoHistory)
* commit & push
* Create a new release on GitHub
* Copy build/tests.js into test/host/legacy/{version}.js
* commit & push

However, once last step was forgotten: closing the milestone.
An [incident](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/148) is created.

## Lessons learned

### Documenting features makes them better

I will task the risk of repeating myself here but the article about
[super](http://gpf-js.blogspot.in/2017/02/my-own-super-implementation.html) made me realize several mistakes in the
implementation of the $super equivalent. Furthermore, taking the time to explore the ECMAScript super keyword gave me a
better understanding of the feature.

In general, it is valuable to step back from the code and document the intent behind a feature.

### Better Selenium detection

One of the reasons why I wanted to remove Selenium was the buggy detection.
Indeed, there are some failures which are not encapsulated properly in a Promise.
As a result, the whole process fails when it happens.

After digging on the web, I found this excellent thread on
[NodeJS Exception handling](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7310521/node-js-best-practice-exception-handling).
It allowed me to handle those unmanaged exceptions the proper way and it secured the detection.

## Next release

The [next release](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/7) will introduce the interface concept.
