## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/6?closed=1) implemented
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.1.7)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.7/doc/index.html)

### Improved $super keyword

When writing the article
[My own super implementation](http://gpf-js.blogspot.in/2017/02/my-own-super-implementation.html)
I found several small issues that were immediately adressed in the library.

### Better tooling

The following tools were modified:
* It is now possible to remove a unused file from the sources page
* Each file modification triggers one pass of tests (they take less than 1 second to execute)
* fs middelware is secured and supports DELETE
* sources.json modification updates the files being monitored and linted so that grunt doesn't have to be restarted

### More flavors for browser testing

Selenium was upgraded to version 3, the detection has been fixed to make it more reliable.
A command line execution wrapper combined with a caching service (to store & grab results) allows to test non
automatable browsers (such as Safari on Windows).

### Automated release

Releasing a version has never been so easy, a script using [github-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-api) module
and based on [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) implements the following steps:
* Check version number
* Update package.json (if needed)
* Check GitHub milestones to identify the milestone details and check that all issues are closed
* Update README.md
* Grunt make
* Copy tmp/plato/report.history.* to build/ (grunt copy:releasePlatoHistory)
* commit & push
* Create a new release on GitHub
* Copy build/tests.js into test/host/legacy/{version}.js
* commit & push

However, I forgot to close the milestone, an [incident](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/issues/148) is created.

## Lessons learned

### Documenting features makes them better


### Better Selenium detection

NodeJS Exception handling

## Next release
