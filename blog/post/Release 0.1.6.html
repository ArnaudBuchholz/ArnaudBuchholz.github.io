## New version

Here comes the new version:
* [Stories and bugs](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/5?closed=1)
* [Sources](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/v0.1.6)
* [Documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.6/doc/index.html)

### Easier setup

The very first time you clone the projet and run grunt, a configuration menu will be prompted:
* It allows you to select the http port the server will run on
* It will detect cscript (or you may force the detection status)
* It allows you to change the quality metrics
* It detects the selenium-compatible browsers

![grunt](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/blog/post/Release%200.1.6/config.png)

Once finished, it builds the library so that the metrics will appear in the project homepage.

### Better compatibility across hosts

One major feature of the library is to provide the same level of features whatever the host it runs on.
Consequently, I am always looking for methods that exist in recent JavaScript versions and that are missing on some
hosts (specifically Rhino and Wscript).

For instance, this version introduces
[Array.prototype.some](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some).

I am also planning to implement [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/
Global_Objects/Object/assign) and deprecate [gpf.extend](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.6/doc/
gpf.html#.extend__anchor) as it does the same.

### Backward compatibility

Each version's test file is now [kept](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/tree/master/test/legacy) and tested
automatically during the build process. This ensures backward compatibility.

### Simple class definition

This version offers the new [gpf.define](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.6/doc/gpf.html#.define__anchor) API.
It simplifies class creation through a definition dictionary,
check the [documentation](https://arnaudbuchholz.github.io/gpf/0.1.6/doc/tutorial-DEFINE.html).

(...) Feedback is welcome

## Lessons learned

### Improving maintainability using regular expression

I found myself using more and more regular expressions to reduce the code complexity.

### Removing Selenium

I have lots of troubles with Selenium, this is due to several reasons:
* I use version 2 and version 3 has been released 5 month ago
* It requires drivers and our browsers are updated almost automatically, it requires drivers update
* FireFox does not work anymore

Because of the way I use Selenium to test the library, I am thinking of a more simple mechanism

## Next release

The [next release](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/gpf-js/milestone/6) will mostly consist in securing the gpf.define
API and handle all the bugs detected during the development of version 0.1.6.
