What is the link between PDF and PONG ? psbots is a Postscript interpreter designed to be small (no dependencies), fast, secure and flexible. In this presentation, you will discover the Postscript language, learn about the psbots implementation and see one example of PONG where paddles are programmatically controlled.

Portable document format
Adobe created PDF on the shoulders of PostScript which was invented 50 years ago. A PDF document is a structure program in which each page is rendered using a language. This language inherits many concepts from PostScript.

Why PostScript ?
20 years ago I learned PostScript as it was required by my job to process printing streams. Indeed, PostScript is still used today to print documents. 
I was surprised by the power and simplicity of this language. 

Small examples (from the web)

PostScript engine
The PostScript engine relies on very basic concepts :
- stacks
    Dictionary stack for the execution context (system, user and host)
Operand
Calls

PostScript particularities
no variables
Shared operand stack
operator shadowing by redefining names in dictionaries
Performance using bind
Super simple syntax : [ 1 ] is actually three instructions

Psbot implementation
Subset of PostScript (no rendering instruction)
And superset of PostScript (finally / catch)
Memory tracking (simulated but relevant) : leak detection
Interruptible (most important characteristic)

Psbots examples

Pong
Last year, I have been invited to a gaming challenge where people could code the paddle using JavaScript
Cool, but !
not real time
No constraint on JavaScript implementation (people could take any time)
Difficult to secure the algorithm
Unfair

My idea
real time
Use psbot for fair time sharing
One tick equals: ball moves and one cycle per paddle

Demo

Future ideas
energy management / pause operator
Increase ball speed
