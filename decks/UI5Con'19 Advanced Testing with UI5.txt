This is a picture of the advanced test reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory, used to test nuclear fuel and materials.
This presentation is about using UI5 to test ODATA services.
It will be published after the conference for you to review it.

2:
Few words about me.
I have been working at SAP for 4 years.
I play a lot with JavaScript, both on front-end and back-end.
As you may hear it, I am French but I live in Canada.

3:
The agenda looks packed but this is the logical sequence of a story that started last year.

4:
Several projects will be covered during this talk.
I don't think it is necessary to introduce OpenUI5.
The training-ui5con18-opa project was initially created for last year presentation but it evolved to support this year conference.
jsdom is an open-source project that was really helpful to build node-ui5.

5:
There is more than UI in UI5.
Since I love code quality and test automation, I remind you that the framework comes with tools to validate the UI.
Besides that, I would like to show you how you can also leverage UI5 to test ODATA services.
However, the official tools for UI5 development are consolidated under UI5 tooling.

First chapter of our story: last year UI5Con

7:
Last year, I presented "A journey with OPA".
Since it was recorded (and the link is available here) I will not replay the whole deck but rather recall some slides required to put you back in the proper context.

8:
UI5 contains the OPA framework, OPA stands for One Page Acceptance.
This toolset is designed to automate and validate the user interface.
By defining journeys and pages, the developer creates a readable abstraction of the user interface.
It means that the test script are easy to maintain.

9:
But, most of the time, an application requires a backend to store data and implement the business logic.
So, when it comes to testing, the dataset must be known to match the scenario.
Furthermore, some operations might be risky. For instance, publishing information or interacting with physical devices:

10:
This is where the MockServer comes into play.
The name itself is confusing. Actually, this software component resides in the browser.
It simulates the backend by hooking AJAX requests before they reach the network.
Then, it decides if and how it should answer.

When it starts, it loads or generate mocked data.
By default, it implements CRUD methods (create, read, update and delete). But it can be customized to extend its capabilities.

11:
Run the app and show the network tab: no requests
With this level of isolation, the OPA tests are self sufficient.
Run the OPA tests.

Second chapter of the story: building a real server using the MockServer


If you want to catch up with OPA or the MockServer, you may have a look to the recording.

ACT 2 MockServer as a server
Some time after this event, I was contacted by a colleague because he was interested to reuse the MockServer
in order to validate a network configuration. Indeed, in his particular scenario, he needed an ODATA server behind
a particular network landscape. Before going in production and to validate the configuration, he thought about the
MockServer.

The initial prototype was using express, socket.io and Puppeteer. Every single request coming to NodeJS was
transmitted to the browser through socket.io...
WE can do better.

After doing some investigation on the web, jsdom appeared to be a solution to simulate a browser directly inside
NodeJS.

It was not enough, I had to load OpenUI5 and ensure that any local file could be loaded through sap.ui.define
=> Ended up rewriting the XmlHttpRequest object
=> Mapping local files

ACT 3 OpenUI5 inside NodeJS

ACT 4 Better ODATA testing

How do you test your ODATA?
Did you try to test batch?
Did you try to envision all the scenarios the UI may do?

Any UI5 application more or less looks like the following
(SPA)

It means that the ODATA communication with the backend is ensurr

When developing the MockServer, you should be able to test it
=> need to develop unit test of MockServer

=> need to be able to run these unit test on top of a real server

Inside Node-UI5 there is a configurable proxy server that can be used
